Rest API
========

As of version 2.1.0 Pact ships with a built-in HTTP server and SQLite
backend. This allows for prototyping blockchain applications with just
the ``pact`` tool.

To start up the server issue ``pact -s config.yaml``, with a suitable
config. The ``pact-lang-api`` JS library is `available via
npm <https://www.npmjs.com/package/pact-lang-api>`__ for web
development.

load.js
-------

The ``load.js`` tool can be used to format valid ``send`` and
``private`` payloads for use with a POST tool like Postman or even
piping into ``curl``.

Endpoints
---------

All endpoints are served from ``api/v1``. Thus a ``send`` call would be
sent to
(http://localhost:8080/api/v1/send)[http://localhost:8080/api/v1/send],
if running on ``localhost:8080``.

Concepts
========

Execution Modes
---------------

Pact is designed to be used in distinct *execution modes* to address the
performance requirements of rapid linear execution on a blockchain.
These are:

1. Contract definition.
2. Transaction execution.
3. Queries and local execution.

Contract Definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this mode, a large amount of code is sent into the blockchain to
establish the smart contract, as comprised of code (modules), tables
(data), and keysets (authorization). This can also include
"transactional" (database-modifying) code, for instance to initialize
data.

For a given smart contract, these should all be sent as a single message
into the blockchain, so that any error will rollback the entire smart
contract as a unit.

Keyset definition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Keysets <#keysets>`__ are customarily defined first, as they are used
to specify admin authorization schemes for modules and tables.
Definition creates the keysets in the runtime environment and stores
their definition in the global keyset database.

Module declaration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Modules <#module>`__ contain the API and data definitions for smart
contracts. They are comprised of:

-  `functions <#defun>`__
-  `schema <#defschema>`__ definitions
-  `table <#deftable>`__ definitions
-  `"pact" <#defpact>`__ special functions
-  `const <#defconst>`__ values

When a module is declared, all references to native functions or
definitions from other modules are resolved. Resolution failure results
in transaction rollback.

Modules can be re-defined as controlled by their admin keyset. Module
versioning is not supported, except by including a version sigil in the
module name (e.g., "accounts-v1"). However, *module hashes* are a
powerful feature for ensuring code safety. When a module is imported
with `use <#use>`__, the module hash can be specified, to tie code to a
particular release.

As of Pact 2.2, ``use`` statements can be issued within a module
declaration. This combined with module hashes provides a high level of
assurance, as updated module code will fail to import if a dependent
module has subsequently changed on the chain; this will also propagate
changes to the loaded modules' hash, protecting downstream modules from
inadvertent changes on update.

Module names must be globally unique.

Table Creation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tables are `created <#create-table>`__ at the same time as modules.
While tables are *defined* in modules, they are *created* "after"
modules, so that the module may be redefined later without having to
necessarily re-create the table.

The relationship of modules to tables is important, as described in
`Table Guards <#tableguards>`__.

There is no restriction on how many tables may be created. Table names
are namespaced with the module name.

Tables can be typed with a `schema <#defschema>`__.

Transaction Execution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Transactions" refer to business events enacted on the blockchain, like
a payment, a sale, or a workflow step of a complex contractual
agreement. A transaction is generally a single call to a module
function. However there is no limit on how many statements can be
executed. Indeed, the difference between "transactions" and "smart
contract definition" is simply the *kind* of code executed, not any
actual difference in the code evaluation.

Queries and Local Execution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Querying data is generally not a business event, and can involve data
payloads that could impact performance, so querying is carried out as a
*local execution* on the node receiving the message. Historical queries
use a *transaction ID* as a point of reference, to avoid any race
conditions and allow asynchronous query execution.

Transactional vs local execution is accomplished by targeting different
API endpoints; pact code has no ability to distinguish between
transactional and local execution.

Database Interaction
--------------------

Pact presents a database metaphor reflecting the unique requirements of
blockchain execution, which can be adapted to run on different
back-ends.

Atomic execution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A single message sent into the blockchain to be evaluated by Pact is
*atomic*: the transaction succeeds as a unit, or does not succeed at
all, known as "transactions" in database literature. There is no
explicit support for rollback handling, except in `multi-step
transactions <#pacts>`__.

Key-Row Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Blockchain execution can be likened to OLTP (online transaction
processing) database workloads, which favor denormalized data written to
a single table. Pact's data-access API reflects this by presenting a
*key-row* model, where a row of column values is accessed by a single
key.

As a result, Pact does not support *joining* tables, which is more
suited for an OLAP (online analytical processing) database, populated
from exports from the Pact database. This does not mean Pact cannot
*record* transactions using relational techniques -- for example, a
Customer table whose keys are used in a Sales table would involve the
code looking up the Customer record before writing to the Sales table.

No Nulls
~~~~~~~~

Pact has no concept of a NULL value in its database metaphor. The main
function for computing on database results, `with-read <#with-read>`__,
will error if any column value is not found. Authors must ensure that
values are present for any transactional read. This is a safety feature
to ensure *totality* and avoid needless, unsafe control-flow surrounding
null values.

Versioned History
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The key-row model is augmented by every change to column values being
versioned by transaction ID. For example, a table with three columns
"name", "age", and "role" might update "name" in transaction #1, and
"age" and "role" in transaction #2. Retreiving historical data will
return just the change to "name" under transaction 1, and the change to
"age" and "role" in transaction #2.

Back-ends
~~~~~~~~~

Pact guarantees identical, correct execution at the smart-contract layer
within the blockchain. As a result, the backing store need not be
identical on different consensus nodes. Pact's implementation allows for
integration of industrial RDBMSs, to assist large migrations onto a
blockchain-based system, by facilitating bulk replication of data to
downstream systems.

Types and Schemas
-----------------

With Pact 2.0, Pact gains explicit type specification, albeit optional.
Pact 1.0 code without types still functions as before, and writing code
without types is attractive for rapid prototyping.

Schemas provide the main impetus for types. A schema `is
defined <#defschema>`__ with a list of columns that can have types
(although this is also not required). Tables are then
`defined <#deftable>`__ with a particular schema (again, optional).

Note that schemas also can be used on/specified for object types.

Runtime Type enforcement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any types declared in code are enforced at runtime. For table schemas,
this means any write to a table will be typechecked against the schema.
Otherwise, if a type specification is encountered, the runtime enforces
the type when the expression is evaluated.

Static Type Inference on Modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the `typecheck <#typecheck>`__ repl command, the Pact interpreter
will analyze a module and attempt to infer types on every variable,
function application or const definition. Using this in project repl
scripts is helpful to aid the developer in adding "just enough types" to
make the typecheck succeed. Fully successful typecheck is usually a
matter of providing schemas for all tables, and argument types for
ancilliary functions that call ambigious or overloaded native functions.

Formal Verification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pact's typechecker is designed to output a fully typechecked, inlined
AST for use generating formal proofs in SMT-LIB2. If the typecheck does
not fully succeed, the module is not considered "provable".

We see, then, that Pact code can move its way up a "safety" gradient,
starting with no types, then with "enough" types, and lastly, with
formal proofs.

Note that as of Pact 2.0 the formal verification function is still under
development.

Keysets and Authorization
-------------------------

Pact is inspired by Bitcoin scripts to incorporate public-key
authorization directly into smart contract execution and administration.

Keyset definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Keysets are `defined <#define-keyset>`__ by `reading <#read-keyset>`__
definitions from the message payload. Keysets consist of a list of
public keys and a *keyset predicate*.

Examples of valid keyset JSON productions:

.. code:: javascript

    /* examples of valid keysets */
    {
      "fully-specified":
        { "keys": ["abc6bab9b88e08d","fe04ddd404feac2"], "pred": "keys-2" }

      "keysonly":
        { "keys": ["abc6bab9b88e08d","fe04ddd404feac2"] } /* defaults to "keys-all" pred */

      "keylist": ["abc6bab9b88e08d","fe04ddd404feac2"] /* makes a "keys-all" pred keyset */
    }

Keyset Predicates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A keyset predicate references a function by name which will compare the
public keys in the keyset to the key or keys used to sign the blockchain
message. The function accepts two arguments, "count" and "matched",
where "count" is the number of keys in the keyset and "matched" is how
many keys on the message signature matched a keyset key.

Support for multiple signatures is the responsibility of the blockchain
layer, and is a powerful feature for Bitcoin-style "multisig" contracts
(ie requiring at least two signatures to release funds).

Pact comes with built-in keyset predicates: `keys-all <#keys-all>`__,
`keys-any <#keys-any>`__, `keys-2 <#keys-2>`__. Module authors are free
to define additional predicates.

If a keyset predicate is not specified, it is defaulted to
`keys-all <#keys-all>`__.

Key rotation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Keysets can be rotated, but only by messages authorized against the
current keyset definition and predicate. Once authorized, the keyset can
be easily `redefined <#define-keyset>`__.

Module Table Guards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When `creating <#create-table>`__ a table, a module name must also be
specified. By this mechanism, tables are "guarded" or "encapsulated" by
the module, such that direct access to the table via `data-access
functions <#Database>`__ is authorized by the module's admin keyset.
However, *within module functions*, table access is unconstrained. This
gives contract authors great flexibility in designing data access, and
is intended to enshrine the module as the main "user" data access API.

Row-level keysets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Keysets can be stored as a column value in a row, allowing for
*row-level* authorization. The following code indicates how this might
be achieved:

.. code:: lisp

    (defun create-account (id)
      (insert accounts id { "balance": 0.0, "keyset": (read-keyset "owner-keyset") }))

    (defun read-balance (id)
      (with-read { "balance":= bal, "keyset":= ks }
        (enforce-keyset ks)
        (format "Your balance is {}" bal)))

In the example, ``create-account`` reads a keyset definition from the
message payload using `read-keyset <#read-keyset>`__ to store as
"keyset" in the table. ``read-balance`` only allows that owner's keyset
to read the balance, by first enforcing the keyset using
`enforce-keyset <#enforce-keyset>`__.

Computational Model
-------------------

Here we cover various aspects of Pact's approach to computation.

Turing-Incomplete
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pact is turing-incomplete, in that there is no recursion (recursion is
detected before execution and results in an error) and no ability to
loop indefinitely. Pact does support operation on list structures via
`map <#map>`__, `fold <#fold>`__ and `filter <#filter>`__, but since
there is no ability to define infinite lists, these are necessarily
bounded.

Turing-incompleteness allows Pact module loading to resolve all
references in advance, meaning that instead of addressing functions in a
lookup table, the function definition is directly injected (or
"inlined") into the callsite. This is an example of the performance
advantages of a Turing-incomplete language.

Single-assignment Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pact allows variable declarations in `let expressions <#let>`__ and
`bindings <#binding>`__. Variables are immutable: they cannot be
re-assigned, or modified in-place.

A common variable declaration occurs in the `with-read <#with-read>`__
function, assigning variables to column values by name. The
`bind <#bind>`__ function offers this same functionality for objects.

Module-global constant values can be declared with
`defconst <#defconst>`__.

Data Types
~~~~~~~~~~

Pact code can be explicitly typed, and is always strongly-typed under
the hood as the native functions perform strict typechecking as
indicated in their documented type signatures. language, but does use
fixed type representations "under the hood" and does no coercion of
types, so is strongly-typed nonetheless.

Pact's supported types are:

-  `Strings <#string>`__
-  `Integers <#integer>`__
-  `Decimals <#decimal>`__
-  `Booleans <#boolean>`__
-  `Key sets <#keysets>`__
-  `Lists <#list>`__
-  `Objects <#object>`__
-  `Function <#defun>`__ and `pact <#defpact>`__ definitions
-  `JSON values <#json>`__
-  `Tables <#deftable>`__
-  `Schemas <#defschema>`__

Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~

Pact is designed to maximize the performance of `transaction
execution <#transactionexec>`__, penalizing queries and module
definition in favor of fast recording of business events on the
blockchain. Some tips for fast execution are:

Single-function transactions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Design transactions so they can be executed with a single function call.

Call with references instead of ``use``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When calling module functions in transactions, use `reference
syntax <#reference>`__ instead of importing the module with
`use <#use>`__. When defining modules that reference other module
functions, ``use`` is fine, as those references will be inlined at
module definition time.

Hardcoded arguments vs. message values
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A transaction can encode values directly into the transactional code:

::

    (accounts.transfer "Acct1" "Acct2" 100.00)

or it can read values from the message JSON payload:

::

    (defun transfer-msg ()
      (transfer (read-msg "from") (read-msg "to")
                (read-decimal "amount")))
    ...
    (accounts.transfer-msg)

The latter will execute slightly faster, as there is less code to
interpret at transaction time.

Types as necessary
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With table schemas, Pact will be strongly typed for most use cases, but
functions that do not use the database might still need types. Use the
`typecheck <typecheck>`__ REPL function to add the necessary types.
There is a small cost for type enforcement at runtime, and too many type
signatures can harm readability. However types can help document an API,
so this is a judgement call.

Control Flow
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pact supports conditionals via `if <#if>`__, bounded looping, and of
course function application.

"If" considered harmful
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Consider avoiding ``if`` wherever possible: every branch makes code
harder to understand and more prone to bugs. The best practice is to put
"what am I doing" code in the front-end, and "validate this transaction
which I intend to succeed" code in the smart contract.

Pact's original design left out ``if`` altogether (and looping), but it
was decided that users should be able to judiciously use these features
as necessary.

Use enforce
^^^^^^^^^^^

"If" should never be used to enforce business logic invariants: instead,
`enforce <#enforce>`__ is the right choice, which will fail the
transaction.

Indeed, failure is the only *non-local exit* allowed by Pact. This
reflects Pact's emphasis on *totality*.

Use built-in keysets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The built-in keyset functions `keys-all <#keys-all>`__,
`keys-any <#keys-any>`__, `keys-2 <#keys-2>`__ are hardcoded in the
interpreter to execute quickly. Custom keysets require runtime
resolution which is slower.

Functional Concepts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pact includes the functional-programming "greatest hits":
`map <#map>`__, `fold <#fold>`__ and `filter <#filter>`__. These all
employ `partial application <#partialapplication>`__, where the list
item is appended onto the application arguments in order to serially
execute the function.

.. code:: lisp

    (map (+ 2) [1 2 3])
    (fold (+) ["Concatenate" " " "me"]

Pact also has `compose <#compose>`__, which allows "chaining"
applications in a functional style.

LISP
~~~~

Pact's use of LISP syntax is intended to make the code reflect its
runtime representation directly, allowing contract authors focus
directly on program execution. Pact code is stored in human-readable
form on the ledger, such that the code can be directly verified, but the
use of LISP-style `s-expression syntax <#sexp>`__ allows this code to
execute quickly.

Message Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pact expects code to arrive in a message with a JSON payload and
signatures. Message data is read using `read-msg <#read-msg>`__ and
related functions, while signatures are not directly readable or
writable -- they are evaluated as part of `keyset
predicate <#keysetpredicates>`__ enforcement.

JSON support
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Values returned from Pact transactions are expected to be directly
represented as JSON values.

When reading values from a message via `read-msg <#read-msg>`__, Pact
coerces JSON types as follows:

-  String -> String
-  Number -> Integer (rounded)
-  Boolean -> Boolean
-  Object -> JSON Value
-  Array -> JSON Value
-  Null -> JSON Value

Decimal values are represented as Strings and read using
`read-decimal <#read-decimal>`__.

JSON Objects, Arrays, and Nulls are not coerced, intended for direct
storage and retreival as opaque payloads in the database.

Confidentiality
---------------

Pact is designed to be used in a *confidentiality-preserving*
environment, where messages are only visible to a subset of
participants. This has significant implications for smart contract
execution.

Entities
~~~~~~~~

An *entity* is a business participant that is able or not able to see a
confidential message. An entity might be a company, a group within a
company, or an individual.

Disjoint Databases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pact smart contracts operate on messages organized by a blockchain, and
serve to produce a database of record, containing results of
transactional executions. In a confidential environment, different
entities execute different transactions, meaning the resulting databases
are now *disjoint*.

This does not affect Pact execution; however, database data can no
longer enact a "two-sided transaction", meaning we need a new concept to
handle enacting a single transaction over multiple disjoint datasets.

Pacts
~~~~~

Pacts are multi-step sequential transactions that are defined as a
single body of code called a `pact <#defpact>`__. With a pact,
participants ensure they are executing an identical code path, even as
they execute distinct "steps" in that path.

The concept of pacts reflect *coroutines* in software engineering:
functions that can *yield* and *resume* computation "in the middle of"
their body. A `step <#step>`__ in a pact designates a target entity to
execute it, after which the pact "yields" execution, completing the
transaction and initiating a signed "Resume" message into the
blockchain.

The function `yield <#yield>`__ and special form `resume <#resume>`__
allow for passing computed values between subsequent steps. These are
not available for rollback functions however.

The counterparty entity sees this "Resume" message and drops back into
the pact body to find if the next step is targetted for it, if so
executing it.

Since any step can fail, steps can be designed with
`rollbacks <#step-with-rollback>`__ to undo changes if a subsequent step
fails.

Note that at this time, it is not possible to simulate multi-party
defpact executions in the pact server environment, as this is
necessarily a multi-node/multi-entity interaction. Pacts can be tested
in repl scripts using the `env-entity <#env-entity>`__,
`env-step <#env-step>`__ and `yielded <#yielded>`__ repl functions to
simulate multi-entity interactions.

Syntax
======

Literals
--------

Strings
~~~~~~~

String literals are created with double-ticks:

::

    pact> "a string"
    "a string"

Strings also support multiline by putting a backslash before and after
whitespace (not interactively).

.. code:: lisp

    (defun id (a)
      "Identity function. \
      \Argument is returned."
      a)

Symbols
~~~~~~~

Symbols are string literals representing some unique item in the
runtime, like a function or a table name. Their representation
internally is simply a string literal so their usage is idiomatic.

Symbols are created with a preceding tick, thus they do no support
whitespace or multiline.

::

    pact> 'a-symbol
    "a-symbol"

Integers
~~~~~~~~

Integer literals are unbounded positive naturals. For negative numbers
use the unary `- <#n->`__ function.

::

    pact> 12345
    12345

Decimals
~~~~~~~~

Decimal literals are positive decimals to exact expressed precision.

::

    pact> 100.25
    100.25
    pact> 356452.23451872
    356452.23451872

Booleans
~~~~~~~~

Booleans are represented by ``true`` and ``false`` literals.

::

    pact> (and true false)
    false

Lists
~~~~~

List literals are created with brackets. Uniform literal lists are given
a type in parsing.

::

    pact> [1 2 3]
    [1 2 3]
    pact> (typeof [1 2 3])
    "[integer]"
    pact> (typeof [1 2 true])
    "list"

Objects
~~~~~~~

Objects are dictionaries, created with curly-braces specifying key-value
pairs using a colon ``:``. For certain applications (database updates),
keys must be strings.

::

    pact> { "foo": (+ 1 2), "bar": "baz" }
    (TObject [("foo",3),("bar","baz")])

Bindings
~~~~~~~~

Bindings are dictionary-like forms, also created with curly braces, to
bind database results to variables using the ``:=`` operator. They are
used in `with-read <#with-read>`__,
`with-default-read <#with-default-read>`__, `bind <#bind>`__ and
`resume <#resume>`__ to assign variables to named columns in a row, or
values in an object.

.. code:: lisp

    (defun check-balance (id)
      (with-read accounts id { "balance" := bal }
        (enforce (> bal 0) (format "Account in overdraft: {}" bal))))

Type specifiers
---------------

Types can be specified in syntax with the colon ``:`` operator followed
by a type literal or user type specification.

Type literals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ``string``
-  ``integer``
-  ``decimal``
-  ``bool``
-  ``keyset``
-  ``list``, or ``[type]`` to specify the list type
-  ``object``, which can be further typed with a schema
-  ``table``, which can be further typed with a schema
-  ``value`` (JSON values)

Schema type literals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A schema defined with `defschema <#defschema>`__ is referenced by name
enclosed in curly braces.

.. code:: lisp

    table:{accounts}
    object:{person}

What can be typed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Function arguments and return types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: lisp

    (defun prefix:string (pfx:string str:string) (+ pfx str))

Let variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: lisp

    (let ((a:integer 1) (b:integer 2)) (+ a b))

Tables and objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tables and objects can only take a schema type literal.

.. code:: lisp

    (deftable accounts:{account})

    (defun get-order:{order} (id) (read orders id))

Consts
^^^^^^

.. code:: lisp

    (defconst PENNY:decimal 0.1)

Special forms
-------------

defun
~~~~~

.. code:: lisp

    (defun NAME ARGLIST [DOCSTRING] BODY...)

Define NAME as a function, accepting ARGLIST arguments, with optional
DOCSTRING. Arguments are in scope for BODY, one or more expressions.

.. code:: lisp

    (defun add3 (a b c) (+ a (+ b c)))

    (defun scale3 (a b c s) "multiply sum of A B C times s"
      (* s (add3 a b c)))

defconst
~~~~~~~~

.. code:: lisp

    (defconst NAME VALUE [DOCSTRING])

Define NAME as VALUE, with option DOCSTRING.

.. code:: lisp

    (defconst COLOR_RED="#FF0000" "Red in hex")
    (defconst COLOR_GRN="#00FF00" "Green in hex")
    (defconst PI 3.14159265 "Pi to 8 decimals")

defpact
~~~~~~~

::

    (defpact NAME ARGLIST [DOCSTRING] STEPS...)

Define NAME as a *pact*, a multistep computation intended for private
transactions. Identical to `defun <#defun>`__ except body must be
comprised of `steps <#step>`__.

.. code:: lisp

    (defpact payment (payer payer-entity payee
                      payee-entity amount)
      (step-with-rollback payer-entity
        (debit payer amount)
        (credit payer amount))
      (step payee-entity
        (credit payee amount)))

defschema
~~~~~~~~~

::

    (defschema NAME [DOCSTRING] FIELDS...)

Define NAME as a *schema*, which specifies a list of FIELDS. Each field
is in the form ``FIELDNAME[:FIELDTYPE]``.

.. code:: lisp

    (defschema accounts
      "Schema for accounts table".
      balance:decimal
      amount:decimal
      ccy:string
      data)

deftable
~~~~~~~~

::

    (deftable NAME[:SCHEMA] [DOCSTRING])

Define NAME as a *table*, used in database functions. Note the table
must still be created with `create-table <#create-table>`__.

let
~~~

::

    (let (BINDPAIR [BINDPAIR [...]]) BODY)

Bind variables in BINDPAIRs to be in scope over BODY. Variables within
BINDPAIRs cannot refer to previously-declared variables in the same let
binding; for this use `let\* <#letstar>`__.

.. code:: lisp

    (let ((x 2)
          (y 5))
      (* x y))
    > 10

let\*
~~~~~

::

    (let\* (BINDPAIR [BINDPAIR [...]]) BODY)

Bind variables in BINDPAIRs to be in scope over BODY. Variables can
reference previously declared BINDPAIRS in the same let. ``let\*`` is
expanded at compile-time to nested ``let`` calls for each BINDPAIR; thus
``let`` is preferred where possible.

.. code:: lisp

    (let* ((x 2)
           (y (* x 10)))
      (+ x y))
    > 22

step
~~~~

::

    (step ENTITY EXPR)

Define a step within a *pact*, which can only be executed by nodes
representing ENTITY, in order of execution specified in containing
`defpact <#defpact>`__.

step-with-rollback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    (step-with-rollback ENTITY EXPR ROLLBACK-EXPR)

Define a step within a *pact*, which can only be executed by nodes
representing ENTITY, in order of execution specified in containing
`defpact <#defpact>`__. If any subsequent steps fail, ROLLBACK-EXPR will
be executed.

use
~~~

::

    (use MODULE)
    (use MODULE HASH)

Import an existing MODULE into namespace. Can only be issued at
top-level, or within a module declaration. MODULE can be a string,
symbol or bare atom. With HASH, validate that module hash matches HASH,
failing if not. Use `describe-module <#describe-module>`__ to query for
the hash of a loaded module on the chain.

.. code:: lisp

    (use accounts)
    (transfer "123" "456" 5 (time "2016-07-22T11:26:35Z"))
    "Write succeeded"

module
~~~~~~

::

    (module NAME KEYSET [DOCSTRING] DEFS...)

Define and install module NAME, guarded by keyset KEYSET, with optional
DOCSTRING. DEFS must be `defun <#defun>`__ or `defpact <#defpact>`__
expressions only.

.. code:: lisp

    (module accounts 'accounts-admin
      "Module for interacting with accounts"

      (defun create-account (id bal)
       "Create account ID with initial balance BAL"
       (insert accounts id { "balance": bal }))

      (defun transfer (from to amount)
       "Transfer AMOUNT from FROM to TO"
       (with-read accounts from { "balance": fbal }
        (enforce (<= amount fbal) "Insufficient funds")
         (with-read accounts to { "balance": tbal }
          (update accounts from { "balance": (- fbal amount) })
          (update accounts to { "balance": (+ tbal amount) }))))
    )

Expressions
-----------

Expressions may be `literals <#literals>`__, atoms, s-expressions, or
references.

Atoms
~~~~~

Atoms are non-reserved barewords starting with a letter or allowed
symbol, and containing letters, digits and allowed symbols. Allowed
symbols are ``%#+-_&$@<>=?*!|/``. Atoms must resolve to a variable bound
by a `defun <#defun>`__, `defpact <#defpact>`__, `binding <#binding>`__
form, or to symbols imported into the namespace with `use <#use>`__.

S-expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

S-expressions are formed with parentheses, with the first atom
determining if the expression is a `special form <#special>`__ or a
function application, in which case the first atom must refer to a
definition.

Partial application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An application with less than the required arguments is in some contexts
a valid *partial application* of the function. However, this is only
supported in Pact's `functional-style functions <#fp>`__; anywhere else
this will result in a runtime error.

References
~~~~~~~~~~

References are two atoms joined by a dot ``.`` to directly resolve to
module definitions.

::

    pact> accounts.transfer
    "(defun accounts.transfer (src,dest,amount,date) \"transfer AMOUNT from
    SRC to DEST\")"
    pact> transfer
    Eval failure:
    transfer<EOF>: Cannot resolve transfer
    pact> (use 'accounts)
    "Using \"accounts\""
    pact> transfer
    "(defun accounts.transfer (src,dest,amount,date) \"transfer AMOUNT from
    SRC to DEST\")"

References are preferred to ``use`` for transactions, as references
resolve faster. However in module definition, ``use`` is preferred for
legibility.
