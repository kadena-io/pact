Pact Smart Contract Language Reference
===

This document is a reference for the Pact smart-contract language, designed for
correct, transactional execution on a [high-performance blockchain](http://kadena.io). For more
background, please see the [white paper](http://kadena.io/docs/Kadena-PactWhitepaper.pdf)
or the [pact home page](http://kadena.io/#pactModal).

Rest API
=======
As of version 2.1.0 Pact ships with a built-in HTTP server and SQLite backend. This allows for prototyping
blockchain applications with just the `pact` tool.

To start up the server issue `pact -s config.yaml`, with a suitable config.
The `pact-lang-api` JS library is [available via npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pact-lang-api) for web development.

### Commands

#### The command object {#the-command-object}

Pact represents blockchain transactions (or commands) as a JSON object with the
following attributes:

##### Attributes

###### `"cmd"`
_type:_ **string (encoded, escaped JSON)** `required`

The component of a transaction that is signed to ensure non-malleability.
Initially, this component is a JSON object containing the transaction payload,
signatories, and platform-specific metadata. When assembling the transaction,
this JSON is "stringified" and provided to the `cmd` field.
If you inspect the output of the
[request formatter in the pact tool](#api-request-formatter),
you will see that the `"cmd"` field, along with any code supplied, are a
String of encoded, escaped JSON. See
[cmd field](#cmd-field) for more information.

###### `"hash"`
_type:_ **string (base64url)** `required`

Blake2 hash of the `cmd` field "stringified" value. Serves as a command's
request key since each transaction must be unique.

###### `"sigs"`
_type:_ **[ object ]** `required`

List of JSON objects containing a cryptographic signature. This signature
is generated using a cryptographic private key to authenticate
the current transaction (i.e. the contents of the `cmd` field). The `ith`
signature must correspond to the `ith` signer in `cmd`'s list of
[signers](#cmd-signers).This signature object has the following attribute(s):

```yaml
name: "sig"                     # Cryptographic signature of current
type: string (base16)           # transaction.
required: true
```

##### Example command
```JSON
// Command with exec payload and Chainweb metadata
{
  "cmds":[{
    "hash":"H6XjdPHzMai2HLa3_yVkXfkFYMgA0bGfsB0kOsHAMuI",
    "sigs":[{
      "sig":"8d452109cc0439234c093b5e204a7428bc0a54f22704402492e027aaa9375a34c910d8a468a12746d0d29e9353f4a3fbebe920d63bcc7963853995db015d060f"
      }],
    "cmd":"{
      \"payload\":{\"exec\":{\"data\":null,\"code\":\"(+ 1 2)\"}},
      \"signers\":[{
        \"addr\":\"368820f80c324bbc7c2b0610688a7da43e39f91d118732671cd9c7500ff43cca\",
        \"scheme\":\"ED25519\",
        \"pubKey\":\"368820f80c324bbc7c2b0610688a7da43e39f91d118732671cd9c7500ff43cca\"
        }],
      \"meta\":{
        \"gasLimit\":1000,
        \"chainId\":\"0\",
        \"gasPrice\":1.0e-2,
        \"sender\":\"sender00\"
        },
      \"nonce\":\"\\\"2019-06-20 20:56:39.509435 UTC\\\"\"
    }"
  }]
}
```


#### The `cmd` field {#cmd-field}

Transactions sent into the blockchain must be hashed in order to ensure the received command is correct; this is also
the value that is signed with the required private keys. To ensure the JSON for the transaction matches byte-for-byte
with the value used to make the hash, the JSON must be *encoded* into the payload as a string
(i.e., ["stringified"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify)).
The `cmd` field holds transaction information as encoded strings. The format of
the JSON to be encoded is as follows:

##### Attributes

###### `"nonce"`
_type:_ **string** `required`

Transaction nonce values. Needs to be unique for every call.

###### `"meta"`
_type:_ **object** `required`

Platform-specific metadata.

###### `"signers"` {#cmd-signers}
_type:_ **[ object ]** `required`

List of JSON object with information on the signers authenticating the
current payload. This signer object has the following attributes:

```yaml
name: "scheme"                # Signer's cryptographic signature scheme.
type: enum (string)           # "ED25519" or "ETH" (Ethereum's ECDSA scheme).
required: false               # Defaults to "ED25519".
```
```yaml
name: "pubKey"                # Public key of signing keypair.
type: string (base16)         # Must be valid public key for specified `scheme`.
required: true
```
```yaml
name: "addr"                  # Address derived from public key, if needed from scheme.
                              # Only ETH scheme requires an address currently.
type: string (base16)         # Must be valid address for specified `scheme`.
required: false               # Defaults to null.
```
```yaml
name: "caps"                  # List of capabilities to scope this signature.
type: list[string]            # Example: ["(accounts.PAY "alice" "bob" 10.0)"]
required: false               # Defaults to empty list.
```

###### `"payload"`
_type:_ [exec](#exec-payload) **or** [cont](#cont-payload) payload `required`

The `cmd` field supports two types of JSON payloads:
the [exec payload](#exec-payload) and the [cont payload](#cont-payload).

##### Example `cmd` field
```json
{
  "cmd":{
      "payload":{
        "exec":{
          "data": null,
          "code": "(+ 1 2)"
        }
      },
      "signers":[{
        "pubKey":"368820f80c324bbc7c2b0610688a7da43e39f91d118732671cd9c7500ff43cca",
        "caps": ["(accounts.PAY \"alice\" \"bob\" 20.0)"]
        }],
      "meta":{
        "gasLimit":1000,
        "chainId":"0",
        "gasPrice":1.0e-2,
        "sender":"sender00"
        },
      "nonce":"\\\"2019-06-20 20:56:39.509435 UTC\\\""
    }
}

```

#### The `exec` payload {#exec-payload}

The `exec` payload holds executable code and data. The [send](#send) and
[local](#local) endpoints support this payload type in the
`cmd` field. The format of the JSON to be encoded is as follows:

##### Attributes

###### `"exec"`
_type:_ **object** `required`

JSON object representing the exec payload. It has the following child attributes:

```yaml
name: "code"          # Pact code to be executed.
type: string
required: true
```
```yaml
name: "data"          # Arbitrary user data to accompany code.
type: object          # Must be `null` or any valid JSON.
required: false       # This data will be injected into the scope of the
                      # pact execution.
```

##### Example `exec` payload
```JSON
{
  "payload":{
    "exec":{
      "data":null,
      "code":"(+ 1 2)"
    }
  }
}
```

#### The `cont` payload {#cont-payload}
The `cont` payload allows for continuing or rolling back [pacts](#pacts).
The [send](#send) and [local](#local) endpoints support this payload type in
the `cmd` field. The format of the JSON to be encoded is as follows:

##### Attributes

###### `"cont"`
_type:_ **object** `required`

JSON object representing the continuation (cont) payload. It has the following
child attributes:

```yaml
name: "pactId"                # The id of the pact to be continued or
type: string (base64url)      # rolled back. This id is equivalent to the
required: true                # request key (payload hash) of the command
                              # that instantiated the pact since only one
                              # pact instantiation is allowed per transaction.
```
```yaml
name: "rollback"              # 'true' to rollback a pact, `false` otherwise.
type: boolean, required
required: true
```
```yaml
name: "step"                  # Step to be continued or rolled back.
type: integer                 # Must be integer between 0 and
required: true                # (total # of steps - 1).
                              # If rolling back, must be the step number of
                              # the step that just executed.
                              # Otherwise, must correspond to one more than
                              # the step that just executed.
```
```yaml
name: "data"                  # Arbitrary user data to accompany code.
type: object                  # Must be `null` or any valid JSON.
required: false               # This data will be injected into the scope of
                              # the pact execution.
```
```yaml
name: "proof"                 # Must be `null` or Bytestring.
type: string (base64url)      # to the fact that the previous step has been
required: false               # confirmed and is recorded in the ledger.
                              # The blockchain automatically verifies this
                              # proof when it is supplied.
                              # If doing cross-chain continuations, then
                              # it MUST be present (not `null`) for each step
                              # in order to validate `yield/resume` data for
                              # each `yield/resume` pair.
```

##### Example `cont` payload

```json
{
  "payload":{
    "cont":{
      "proof":"[proof base64url value]",
      "data":{
        "final-price":12.0
      },
      "pactId":"bNWr_FjKZ2sxzo7NNLTtWA64oysWw6Xqe_PZ_qSeEU0",
      "rollback":false,
      "step":1
    }
  }
}
```

A successful pact execution will return a value that is valid JSON. A pact
value can be one of the following: a literal string, integer, decimal, boolean,
or time; a list of other pact values; an object mapping textual keys to pact
values; or [guards](#guard-types), which can be pact (continuation) guards,
module guards, user guards, keysets, or references to a keysets. Below is the JSON representation of these values:

##### Types

JSON object mapping string keys to [pact values](#pact-values).

###### `pact guard`
_type:_ **object**
```yaml
name: "pactId"                # id of the specific `defpact` execution in
type: string (base64url)      # which the guard was created. Thus, the
required: true                # guard will only pass if being accessed by
                              # code in subsequent steps of that particular
                              # pact execution (i.e. having the same
                              # pact id).
```
```yaml
name: "name"                  # Name of the guard
type: string
required: true
```

###### `module guard`

type: string
required: true
```

###### `user guard`
_type:_ **object**
```yaml

```
```yaml
name: "predFun"   # Name of function governing the user guard.
type: string
required: true
```

###### `keysets`
_type:_ **[KeySet](#keysets-and-authorization)**


###### `keyset references`
_type:_ **object**
```YAML
name: "keyNamef"    # Name of keyset being referenced.
type: string
required: true
```

#### Pact errors {#pact-errors}
When an error occurs during a pact execution, the following JSON object is
returned in Command Result's `result` field:

##### Attributes

###### `"callStack"`
_type:_ **array (string)** `required`

List of stack traces (i.e. active stack frames) during the pact execution error.

###### `"info"`
_type:_ **string** `required`

The parsed pact code that produced the error.

###### `"message"`
_type:_ **string** `required`

The error message that was produced.

###### `"type"`
_type:_ **enum (string)** `required`

The type of pact error that was produced. The error type must be one of the
following:

- "EvalError"
- "ArgsError"
- "DbError"
- "TxFailure"
- "SyntaxError"
- "GasError"

##### Example pact error
```JSON

  "callStack":["<interactive>:0:0: (+ 1 2 3)"],
  "type":"ArgsError",
  "message":"Invalid arguments, received [1 2 3] for [ x:<a[integer,decimal]> y:<a[integer\n,decimal]> -> <a[integer,decimal]>\n, x:<a[integer,decimal]> y:<b[integer,decimal]> -> decimal\n, x:<a[string,[<l>],object:<{o}>]> y:<a[string,[<l>],object:<{o}>]> -> <a[string\n,[<l>]\n,object:<{o}>]> ]",
  "info":"<interactive>:0:0"
}
```

### Endpoints

All endpoints are served from `api/v1`. Thus a `send` call would be sent
to <http://localhost:8080/api/v1/send>, if running on `localhost:8080`.
Each endpoint section specifies the request body schema they expect and the
schema of their response. If they receive an invalid request body, an HTTP
`400 Bad Request Error` will be returned. All endpoints also consume and
produce `application/json;charset=utf-8`.

One way to interact with the endpoints is to use Pact's
[API Request formatter](#api-request-formatter) and `curl`.

```shell
#!/bin/sh

set -e

JSON="Content-Type: application/json"

echo ""; echo "Step 1"; echo ""
pact -a examples/accounts/scripts/01-system.yaml | curl -H "$JSON" -d @- http://localhost:8080/api/v1/send
sleep 1; echo ""
curl -H "$JSON" -d '{"requestKeys":["zaqnRQ0RYzxTccjtYoBvQsDo5K9mxr4TEF-HIYTi5Jo"]}' -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/poll
```

#### /send

```shell
POST /api/v1/send
```

Asynchronous submission of one or more public (unencrypted) commands to the blockchain.
See [cmd field](#cmd-field) format regarding the stringified JSON data.

##### Request schema

###### `"cmds"`
_type:_ **[ [Command](#the-command-object) ]** `required`

List of [Command](#the-command-object) objects to be submitted to the blockchain.
Expects each command to have stringified JSON payload.

##### Example request

```JSON

API request formatter
---

As of Pact 2.2.3, the `pact` tool now accepts the `-a` option to format API request JSON,
using a YAML file describing the request. The output can then be used with a POST tool like
Postman or even piping into `curl`.

For instance, a yaml file called "apireq.yaml" with the following contents:

```yaml
code: "(+ 1 2)"
data:
  name: Stuart
  language: Pact
keyPairs:
  - public: ba54b224d1924dd98403f5c751abdd10de6cd81b0121800bf7bdbdcfaec7388d
    secret: 8693e641ae2bbe9ea802c736f42027b03f86afe63cae315e7169c9c496c17332
```

can be fed into `pact` to obtain a valid API request:

```shell
$ pact -a tests/apireq.yaml -l
{"hash":"444669038ea7811b90934f3d65574ef35c82d5c79cedd26d0931fddf837cccd2c9cf19392bf62c485f33535983f5e04c3e1a06b6b49e045c5160a637db8d7331","sigs":[{"sig":"9097304baed4c419002c6b9690972e1303ac86d14dc59919bf36c785d008f4ad7efa3352ac2b8a47d0b688fe2909dbf392dd162457c4837bc4dc92f2f61fd20d","scheme":"ED25519","pubKey":"ba54b224d1924dd98403f5c751abdd10de6cd81b0121800bf7bdbdcfaec7388d","addr":"ba54b224d1924dd98403f5c751abdd10de6cd81b0121800bf7bdbdcfaec7388d"}],"cmd":"{\"address\":null,\"payload\":{\"exec\":{\"data\":{\"name\":\"Stuart\",\"language\":\"Pact\"},\"code\":\"(+ 1 2)\"}},\"nonce\":\"\\\"2017-09-27 19:42:06.696533 UTC\\\"\"}"}

```

Here's an example of piping into curl, hitting a pact server running on port 8080:

```shell
$ pact -a tests/apireq.yaml -l | curl -d @- http://localhost:8080/api/v1/local
{"status":"success","response":{"status":"success","data":3}}
```


### Request YAML file format {#request-yaml}
Request yaml files takes two forms. An *execution* Request yaml file describes the [exec](#exec-payload) payload.
Meanwhile, a *continuation* Request yaml file describes the [cont](#cont-payload) payload.

The execution Request yaml takes the following keys:

```yaml
  code: Transaction code
  codeFile: Transaction code file
  data: JSON transaction data
  dataFile: JSON transaction data file
  keyPairs: list of key pairs for signing (use pact -g to generate): [
    public: base 16 public key
    secret: base 16 secret key
    ]
  nonce: optional request nonce, will use current time if not provided
  from: entity name for addressing private messages
  to: entity names for addressing private messages
```

The continuation Request yaml takes the following keys:

```yaml
  type: "cont"
  txId: Integer transaction id of pact
  step: Integer next step of a pact
  rollback: Boolean for rollingback a pact
  data: JSON transaction data
  dataFile: JSON transaction data file
  keyPairs: list of key pairs for signing (use pact -g to generate): [
    public: base 16 public key
    secret: base 16 secret key
    ]
  nonce: optional request nonce, will use current time if not provided
  from: entity name for addressing private messages
  to: entity names for addressing private messages
```




Concepts {#concepts}
========

Execution Modes {#execmodes}
---

Pact is designed to be used in distinct *execution modes* to address
the performance requirements of rapid linear execution on a
blockchain. These are:

1. Contract definition.
2. Transaction execution.
3. Queries and local execution.

### Contract Definition {#definitionmode}

In this mode, a large amount of code is sent into the blockchain to
establish the smart contract, as comprised of modules (code), tables
(data), and keysets (authorization). This can also include "transactional"
(database-modifying) code, for instance to initialize data.

For a given smart contract, these should all be sent as a single message
into the blockchain, so that any error will rollback the entire smart contract
as a unit.

#### Keyset definition {#keysetdefinition}

[Keysets](#confidential-keysets) are customarily defined first, as they are used to specify
admin authorization schemes for modules and tables. Definition creates the keysets
in the runtime environment and stores their definition in the global keyset database.

#### Namespace declaration {#namespacedefinition}

[Namespace](#namespaces) declarations provide a unique prefix for modules and interfaces defined within the namespace scope. Namespaces are handled differently in public and private blockchain contexts: in private they are freely definable, and the _root namespace_ (ie, not using a namespace at all) is available for user code. In public blockchains, users are not allowed to use the root namespace (which is reserved for built-in contracts like the coin contract) and must define code within a namespace, which may or may not be definable (ie, users might be restricted to "user" namespaces).

Namespaces are defined using [define-namespace](#define-namespace). Namespaces are "entered" by issuing the [namespace](#namespace) command.

#### Module declaration {#moduledeclaration}

[Modules](#module) contain the API and data definitions for smart contracts. They are comprised of:

- [functions](#defun)
- [schema](#defschema) definitions
- [table](#deftable) definitions
- [pact](#defpact) special functions
- [constant](#defconst) values
- [models](pact-properties.html)

When a module is declared, all references to native functions, interfaces, or definitions from other modules are resolved. Resolution failure results in transaction rollback.

Modules can be re-defined as controlled by their governance capabilities. Often, such a function is simply a reference to an administrative keyset. Module versioning is not supported, except by including a version sigil in the module name (e.g., "accounts-v1"). However, *module hashes* are a powerful feature for ensuring code safety. When a module is imported with [use](#use), the module hash can be specified, to tie code to a particular release.

As of Pact 2.2, `use` statements can be issued within a module declaration. This combined with module hashes provides a high level of assurance, as updated module code will fail to import if a dependent module has subsequently changed on the chain; this will also propagate changes to the loaded modules' hash, protecting downstream modules from inadvertent changes on update.

Module names must be unique within a namespace.

#### Interface Declaration {#interfacedeclaration}

[Interfaces](#interface) contain an API specification and data definitions for smart contracts.
They are comprised of:

- [function](#defun) specifications (i.e. function signatures)
- [constant](#defconst) values
- [models](pact-properties.html)

Interfaces represent an abstract api that a [module](#module) may implement by issuing an `implements` statement within the module declaration. Interfaces may import definitions from other modules by issuing a [use](#use) declaration, which may be used to construct new constant definitions, or make use of types defined in the imported module. Unlike Modules, Interface versioning is not supported. However, modules may implement multiple interfaces.

Interface names must be unique within a namespace.

#### Table Creation {#tablecreation}

Tables are [created](pact-functions.html#create-table) at the same time as modules. While tables are *defined* in
modules, they are *created* "after" modules, so that the module may be redefined later without
having to necessarily re-create the table.

The relationship of modules to tables is important, as described in [Table Guards](#module-table-guards).

There is no restriction on how many tables may be created. Table names are namespaced with
the module name.

Tables can be typed with a [schema](#defschema).

### Transaction Execution {#transaction-execution}

"Transactions" refer to business events enacted on the blockchain, like a payment, a sale, or
a workflow step of a complex contractual agreement. A transaction is generally a single call to
a module function. However there is no limit on how many statements can be executed. Indeed,
the difference between "transactions" and "smart contract definition" is simply the *kind* of code
executed, not any actual difference in the code evaluation.

### Queries and Local Execution {#queries}

Querying data is generally not a business event, and can involve data payloads that could impact
performance, so querying is carried out as a *local execution* on the node receiving the message.
Historical queries use a *transaction ID* as a point of reference, to avoid any race
conditions and allow asynchronous query execution.

Transactional vs local execution is accomplished by targeting different API endpoints; pact code
has no ability to distinguish between transactional and local execution.

Database Interaction {#dbinteraction}
---

Pact presents a database metaphor reflecting the unique requirements of blockchain execution,
which can be adapted to run on different back-ends.

### Atomic execution {#atomicexecution}

A single message sent into the blockchain to be evaluated by Pact is *atomic*: the transaction
succeeds as a unit, or does not succeed at all, known as "transactions" in database literature.
There is no explicit support for rollback handling, except in [multi-step transactions](#pacts).

### Key-Row Model {#dbkeyrow}

Blockchain execution can be likened to OLTP (online transaction processing) database workloads,
which favor denormalized data written to a single table. Pact's data-access API reflects this
by presenting a *key-row* model, where a row of column values is accessed by a single key.

As a result, Pact does not support *joining* tables, which is more suited for an OLAP (online
analytical processing) database, populated from exports from the Pact database. This does not
mean Pact cannot *record* transactions using relational techniques -- for example, a Customer table whose keys
are used in a Sales table would involve the code looking up the Customer record before writing
to the Sales table.

### Queries and Performance {#queryperformance}

As of Pact 2.3, Pact offers a powerful query mechanism for selecting multiple rows from a table.
While visually similar to SQL, the [select](pact-functions.html#select) and [where](pact-functions.html#where) operations offer a
_streaming interface_ to a table, where the user provides filter functions, and then operates
on the rowset as a list data structure using [sort](pact-functions.html#sort) and other functions.

```lisp

;; the following selects Programmers with salaries >= 90000 and sorts by age descending

(reverse (sort ['age]
  (select 'employees ['first-name,'last-name,'age]
    (and? (where 'title (= "Programmer"))
          (where 'salary (< 90000))))))

;; the same query could be performed on a list with 'filter':

(reverse (sort ['age]
  (filter (and? (where 'title (= "Programmer"))
                (where 'salary (< 90000)))
          employees)))

```

In a transactional setting, Pact database interactions are optimized for single-row reads and writes,
meaning such queries can be slow and prohibitively expensive computationally. However, using the
[local](#local) execution capability, Pact can utilize the user filter functions on the streaming
results, offering excellent performance.

The best practice is therefore to use select operations via local, non-transactional operations,
and avoid using select on large tables in the transactional setting.

### No Nulls {#nonulls}

Pact has no concept of a NULL value in its database metaphor. The main function for computing
on database results, [with-read](pact-functions.html#with-read), will error if any column value is not found.
Authors must ensure that values are present for any transactional read. This is a safety feature
to ensure *totality* and avoid needless, unsafe control-flow surrounding null values.

### Versioned History {#dbversions}

The key-row model is augmented by every change to column values being versioned by transaction ID.
For example, a table with three columns "name", "age", and "role" might update "name" in transaction #1,
and "age" and "role" in transaction #2. Retrieving historical data will return just the change to "name"
under transaction 1, and the change to "age" and "role" in transaction #2.

### Back-ends {#backends}

Pact guarantees identical, correct execution at the smart-contract layer within the blockchain. As
a result, the backing store need not be identical on different consensus nodes.
Pact's implementation allows for integration of industrial RDBMSs, to assist large migrations onto
a blockchain-based system, by facilitating bulk replication of data to downstream systems.

Types and Schemas
---

With Pact 2.0, Pact gains explicit type specification, albeit optional. Pact 1.0 code without
types still functions as before, and writing code without types is attractive for rapid prototyping.

Schemas provide the main impetus for types. A schema [is defined](#defschema) with a list of
columns that can have types (although this is also not required). Tables are then [defined](#deftable)
with a particular schema (again, optional).

Note that schemas also can be used on/specified for object types.

### Runtime Type enforcement

Any types declared in code are enforced at runtime. For table schemas, this means any write
to a table will be typechecked against the schema. Otherwise, if a type specification is
encountered, the runtime enforces the type when the expression is evaluated.

### Static Type Inference on Modules

With the [typecheck](pact-functions.html#typecheck) repl command, the Pact interpreter will analyze a module
and attempt to infer types on every variable, function application or const definition.
Using this in project repl scripts is helpful to aid the developer in adding "just enough types"
to make the typecheck succeed. Successful typechecking is usually a matter of providing
schemas for all tables, and argument types for ancillary functions that call ambiguous or
overloaded native functions.

### Formal Verification

Pact's typechecker is designed to output a fully typechecked and inlined AST for generating
formal proofs in the SMT-LIB2 language. If the typecheck does not succeed, the module is not
considered "provable".

We see, then, that Pact code can move its way up a "safety" gradient, starting with no types,
then with "enough" types, and lastly, with formal proofs.

Note that as of Pact 2.0 the formal verification function is still under development.


Keysets and Authorization {#confidential-keysets}
---

Pact is inspired by Bitcoin scripts to incorporate public-key authorization directly into smart
contract execution and administration. Pact seeks to take this further by making single- and multi-sig
interactions ubiquitous and effortless with the concept of _keysets_, meaning that single-signature
mode is never assumed: anywhere public-key signatures are used, single-sig and multi-sig can interoperate
effortlessly. Finally, all crypto is handled by the Pact runtime to ensure programmers can't make
mistakes "writing their own crypto".

Also see [Guards and Capabilities](#caps) below for how Pact
moves beyond just keyset-based authorization.

### Keyset definition

Keysets are [defined](pact-functions.html#define-keyset) by [reading](pact-functions.html#read-keyset) definitions from the message
payload. Keysets consist of a list of public keys and a *keyset predicate*.

Examples of valid keyset JSON productions:

```javascript
/* examples of valid keysets */
{
  "fully-specified-with-native-pred":
    { "keys": ["abc6bab9b88e08d","fe04ddd404feac2"], "pred": "keys-2" },

  "fully-specified-with-qual-custom":
    { "keys": ["abc6bab9b88e08d","fe04ddd404feac2"], "pred": "my-module.custom-pred" },

  "keysonly":
    { "keys": ["abc6bab9b88e08d","fe04ddd404feac2"] }, /* defaults to "keys-all" pred */

  "keylist": ["abc6bab9b88e08d","fe04ddd404feac2"] /* makes a "keys-all" pred keyset */
}

```

### Keyset Predicates {#keyset-predicates}

A keyset predicate references a function by its (optionally qualified) name, and will compare the public keys in the keyset
to the key or keys used to sign the blockchain message. The function accepts two arguments,
"count" and "matched", where "count" is the number of keys in the keyset and "matched" is how many
keys on the message signature matched a keyset key.

Support for multiple signatures is the responsibility of the blockchain layer, and is a powerful
feature for Bitcoin-style "multisig" contracts (i.e. requiring at least two signatures to release funds).

Pact comes with built-in keyset predicates: [keys-all](pact-functions.html#keys-all), [keys-any](pact-functions.html#keys-any), [keys-2](pact-functions.html#keys-2).
Module authors are free to define additional predicates.

If a keyset predicate is not specified, [keys-all](pact-functions.html#keys-all) is used by default.

### Key rotation {#keyrotation}

Keysets can be rotated, but only by messages authorized against the current keyset definition
and predicate. Once authorized, the keyset can be easily [redefined](#define-keyset).

### Module Table Guards {#tableguards}

When [creating](pact-functions.html#create-table) a table, a module name must also be specified. By this mechanism,
tables are "guarded" or "encapsulated" by the module, such that direct access to the table
via [data-access functions](pact-functions.html#database) is authorized only by the module's governance.
However, *within module functions*, table access is unconstrained. This gives contract authors great
flexibility in designing data access, and is intended to enshrine the module as the main
"user data access API".

See also [module guards](#module-guards) for how this concept can be leveraged to protect more than
just tables.

### Row-level keysets {#rowlevelkeysets}

Keysets can be stored as a column value in a row, allowing for *row-level* authorization.
The following code indicates how this might be achieved:

```lisp
(defun create-account (id)
  (insert accounts id { "balance": 0.0, "keyset": (read-keyset "owner-keyset") }))

(defun read-balance (id)
  (with-read accounts id { "balance":= bal, "keyset":= ks }
    (enforce-keyset ks)
    (format "Your balance is {}" [bal])))
```

In the example, `create-account` reads a keyset definition from the message payload using [read-keyset](pact-functions.html#read-keyset)
to store as "keyset" in the table. `read-balance` only allows that owner's keyset to read the balance,
by first enforcing the keyset using [enforce-keyset](pact-functions.html#enforce-keyset).

Namespaces {#namespaces}
---

Namespaces are [defined](pact-functions.html#define-namespace) by specifying a namespace name and [associating](pact-functions.html#read-keyset)
a keyset with the namespace. Namespace scope is entered by declaring the namespace environment. All definitions issued after the namespace scope is entered will be accessible by their fully qualified names. These names are of the form _namespace.module.definition_. This form can also be used to access code outside of the current namespace for the purpose of importing module code, or implementing modules:

```lisp
(implements my-namespace.my-interface)
;; or
(use my-namespace.my-module)
```

Code may be appended to the namespace by simply entering the re-entering the namespace and declaring new code definitions. All definitions _must_ occur within a namespace, as the global namespace (the empty namespace) is reserved for Kadena code.

Examples of valid namespace definition and scoping:

#### Example: Defining a namespace

Defining a namespace requires a keyset, and a namespace name of type string:

```lisp
(define-keyset 'my-keyset)
(define-namespace 'my-namespace (read-keyset 'my-keyset))

pact> (namespace 'my-namespace)
"Namespace set to my-namespace"
```

#### Example: Accessing members of a namespace

Members of a namespace may be accessed by their fully-qualified names:

```lisp
pact> (my-namespace.my-module.hello-number 3)
"Hello, your number is 3!"

;; alternatively
pact> (use my-namespace.my-module)
"Using my-namespace.my-module"
pact> (hello-number 3)
"Hello, your number is 3!"

```

#### Example: Importing module code or implementing interfaces at a namespace

Modules may be imported at a namespace, and interfaces my be implemented in a similar way. This allows the user to work with members of a namespace in a much less verbose and cumbersome way.


```lisp
; in my-namespace
(module my-module EXAMPLE_GUARD
  (implements my-other-namespace.my-interface)

  (defcap EXAMPLE_GUARD ()
    (enforce-keyset 'my-keyset))

  (defun hello-number:string (number:integer)
    (format "Hello, your number is {}!" [number]))
)

```

#### Example: appending code to a namespace

If one is simply appending code to an existing namespace, then the namespace prefix in the fully qualified name may be ommitted, as using a namespace works in a similar way to importing a module: all toplevel definitions within a namespace are brought into scope when `(namespace 'my-namespace)` is declared. Continuing from the previous example:

```lisp
pact> (my-other-namespace.my-other-module.more-hello 3)
"Hello, your number is 3! And more hello!"

; alternatively
pact> (namespace 'my-other-namespace)
"Namespace set to my-other-namespace"

pact> (use my-other-module)
"Using my-other-module"

pact> (more-hello 3)
"Hello, your number is 3! And more hello!"

```

Guards and Capabilities {#caps}
---

Pact 3.0 introduces powerful new concepts to allow programmers to express and implement authorization schemes correctly and easily:
_guards_, which generalize keysets, and _capabilities_, which generalize authorizations or rights.

### Guards
A guard is essentially a predicate function over some environment that enables a pass-fail operation, `enforce-guard`,
to be able to test a rich diversity of conditions.

A keyset is the quintessential guard: it specifies a list of keys,
and a predicate function to verify how many keys were used to sign the current transaction. Enforcement
happens via `enforce-keyset`, causing the transaction to fail if the necessary keys are not found in the signing set.

However, there are other predicates that are equally useful:

- We might want to enforce that a _module_ is the only entity that can perform some function, for instance
to debit some account.

- We might want to ensure that a user has provided some secret, like a hash preimage, as seen in atomic swaps.

- We might want to combine all of the above into a single, enforceable rule: "ensure user A signed the transaction AND
provided a hash preimage AND is only executable by module `foo`".

Finally, we want guards to _interoperate_ with each other, so that smart contract code doesn't have to worry about
what kind of guard is used to mediate access to some resource or right. For instance, it is easy to think of entries
in a ledger having diverse guards, where some tokens are guarded by keysets, while others are autonomously owned by
modules, while others are locked in some kind of escrow transaction: what's important is that the guard always be enforced
for the given account, not what type of guard it is.

Guards address all of these needs. Keysets are now just one type of guard, to which we add module guards,
pact guards, and completely customizable "user guards". You can store any type of guard in the database using the `guard`
type. The `keyset` type is still supported, but developers should switch to `guard` to enjoy the enhanced flexibility.

### Capabilities

The guards concept is powerful, but incomplete. In a given workflow, the _act of enforcing_ a keyset or any guard is hard
to encapsulate or reason about, and the result of enforcement -- that is, the granting of some right -- can only be expressed
sequentially, by literally ensuring that the protected code "happens after" the enforcement. The granted right itself has no
expression in the code beyond "we did stuff after enforcing some guard".

With capabilities, Pact gains the ability to express such a granted right, or capability, directly in code, and use that
capability to organize and govern code.

Let's look at the classic ledger-oriented use case to illustrate. The normal workflow to allow debiting some account balance
is to enforce a keyset stored in the account table:

```lisp
(defun debit (user amount)
  (with-read accounts user { "keyset" := keyset, "balance" := balance }
    (enforce-keyset keyset)
    (update accounts user { "balance" := (- balance debit) }))
)
```

Expressed as a capability, we could say that "the act of enforcing the user keyset allows you to update", and importantly,
we can declare exactly what code is controlled by this capability:

```lisp
(defcap DEBIT (user)
  "Capability to debit a user account balance, enforcing the keyset".
  (with-read accounts user { "keyset" := keyset }
    (enforce-keyset keyset)
))

(defun debit (user amount)
  (with-capability (DEBIT user)
    (update accounts user { "balance" := (- balance debit) }))
)
```

What have we gained? We've given the act of checking the keyset a name, `DEBIT`, by defining the capability with
[`defcap`](#defcap). We've also used [`with-capability`](#with-capability) to invoke the capability in a _scope_, within
which we call `update`.

Capabilities allow Pact to directly represent grants or rights, and offer some very useful features for controlling
how code is executed. They come from the "capabilities" concept in computer science, which seeks to make ambient rights
concrete or "reified", instead of just being enforced ad-hoc. Capabilities are often contrasted with "access control
lists" in UNIX, where a list of users is maintained to allow access to, say, the contents of some directory. By explicitly
handing some process a data object representing their right to access some resource, we have more control over that
right, including the ability to revoke it in real time.

In Pact, the concept gets narrowed to simply allow for a right to be granted over the body of some code, but it is still
surprisingly useful for a number of goals.

### Guards vs Capabilities
Guards and capabilities can be confusing: given we have guards and things like keysets, what do we need the capability concept
for?

Guards allow us to define a _rule_ that must be satisfied for the transaction to proceed. As such, they really are just
a way to declare a pass-fail condition or predicate. The Pact guard system is flexible enough to express any rule you can code.

Capabilities allow us to declare how that rule is deployed. In doing so, they illustrate the critical rights that are
extended to users of the smart contract, and "protect" code from being called incorrectly. Finally, they tightly scope what
code is protected, and allow the ability for code to demand that some capability _is already enforced_.

### Protecting code with `require-capability`

The function [require-capability](#require-capability) can be used to "protect" a function from being called improperly:

```lisp
(defun debit (user amount)
  (require-capability (DEBIT user)
    (update accounts user ...)))
```

This effectively prevents the function from ever being called at top-level. **Capabilities can only be granted by the module
code that declares them**, which is an important security property, as it ensures an attacker cannot elevate their privileges
from outside.

Written this way, the only way `debit` could be called is by some other module code, like `transfer`:

```lisp
(defun transfer (to from amount)
  (with-capability (DEBIT from)
    (debit from amount)
    (credit to amount)))
```

Here, the `with-capability` call runs the code in `DEBIT`, which on success installs the "DEBIT [from]" capability
into the Pact environment. When `debit` issues `require-capability (DEBIT user)`, the code will succeed. Meanwhile, if
somebody directly called `debit` from outside, the code will fail.

### Modeling capabilities

The only problem with the above code is it pushed the awareness of DEBIT into the `transfer` function, whereas
separation of concerns would better have it housed in `debit`. What's more, we'd like to ensure that `debit` is always called
in a "transfer" capacity, that is, that the corresponding `credit` occurs. Thus, the better way to model this is with
two capabilities, with TRANSFER being a "no-guard" capability that simply encloses `debit` and `credit` calls:

```lisp
(defcap TRANSFER
  "Capability to govern credit and debit calls"
  true)

(defun transfer (to from amount)
  (with-capability (TRANSFER)
    (debit from amount)
    (credit to amount)))

(defun debit (user amount)
  (require-capability (TRANSFER)
    (with-capability (DEBIT from)
      (update accounts user ...))))

(defun credit (user amount)
  (require-capability (TRANSFER)
    (update accounts user ...)))
```

Thus, `TRANSFER` protects `debit` and `credit` from being used improperly, while `DEBIT` governs specifically the
ability to debit.

### Improving efficiency
Once capabilities are granted they are installed into the pact environment for the scope of the call to `with-capability`;
once that form is exited, the capability is uninstalled. This scoping alone is a security improvement, as it clearly delineates
when the right is in effect (ie it doesn't "bleed" into the outer calling environment). However, it also can
improve efficiency.

To illustrate, let's specify an operation to rotate the user's keyset, which like debit requires enforcing
the user keyset first. Since checking the user keyset is now a more general capability, we rename it USER_KEYSET,
and use it for both debit and rotate:

```lisp
(defcap USER_KEYSET (user)
  (with-read accounts user { "keyset" := keyset }
    (enforce-keyset keyset)))

(defun debit (user amount)
  (require-capability (TRANSFER)
    (with-capability (USER_KEYSET from) ...)))

(defun rotate (user new-keyset)
  (with-capability (USER_KEYSET user) ...))
```
So far so good. However, if we had a (admittedly contrived) `rotate-and-transfer` function, we'd be calling that
code twice, which is inefficient. This can be solved by acquiring the capability at the outer level, because
**capabilities that have already been acquired and are in-scope are not re-evaluated:**

```lisp
(defun rotate-and-transfer (from to from-new-keyset amount)
  (with-capability (USER_KEYSET from) ;; installs USER_KEYSET for 'from'
    (transfer from to amount)         ;; 'debit' now won't reperform check
    (rotate from from-new-keyset)))   ;; nor will 'rotate'
```

### Composing capabilities
Capabilities can be _composed_, in order to bring multiple capabilities into a single scope. Imagine
that our use case required the USER_KEYSET capability but also that OPERATE_ADMIN had additionally signed
the transaction. We can compose these into a new composite capability:

```lisp
(defcap OPERATE_AND_USER_KEYSET (user)
  (compose-capability (OPERATE_ADMIN))
  (compose-capability (USER_KEYSET user)))
```

Now, a call to `(with-capability (OPERATE_AND_USER_KEYSET user) ...)` will bring the two capabilities into
scope, if not already there. Capabilities are never introduced twice, so if an outer code block had already
granted OPERATE_ADMIN, just that capability would stay in scope (and not be evaluated twice) outside of the inner
scope.

### `defcap` details

`defcap` is used to define capabilities, and it looks like a normal function. However capabilities
differ from normal functions in some important ways. A capability definition does double-duty by
both _parameterizing_ a capability that will be stored as a unique token in the environment, as well
as _implementing_ the enforcing code that protects the capability from being improperly granted.

For example, a capability `(USER_KEYSET "alice")` results in a token (USER_KEYSET,"alice") being stored
in the environment, as distinct from (USER_KEYSET,"bob") etc. This token is what is checked by
`(require-capability (USER_KEYSET "alice"))`, so that even though it looks like the USER_KEYSET code
is being called, it is actually just being "referenced" to test for the token.

Likewise, `(with-capability (USER_KEYSET "alice") ...)` does not _necessarily_ call the code in the defcap:
it accesses the unique token to see if it is already present in the environment. Only if it is not
present does it actually execute the code in the `defcap` body.

As a result, **`defcap`s cannot be executed directly**, as this would violate the semantics described here.
This is an important security property as it ensures that the granting code can only be called in the
appropriate way.

### Scoping signatures with capabilities

Pact 3.3 introduces the ability to limit the scope of a signature such that any keysets requiring the signer
key will only pass if checked in the context of the specified capability. This can be simulated using the
new `env-sigs` REPL function as follows:

```lisp
(module accounts GOV
  ...
  (defcap PAY (sender receiver amount)
    (enforce-keyset (at 'keyset (read accounts sender))))

  (defun pay (sender receiver amount)
    (with-capability (PAY sender receiver amount)
      (transfer sender receiver amount)))
  ...
)

(set-sigs [{'key: "alice", 'caps: ["(accounts.PAY \"alice\" \"bob\" 10.0)"]}])
(accounts.pay "alice" "bob" 10.0) ;; works as the cap match the signature caps

(set-sigs [('key: "alice", 'caps: ["(accounts.PAY \"alice\" "\carol\" 10.0)"]}])
(expect-failure "payment to bob will no longer be able to enforce alice's keyset"
  (accounts.pay "alice" "bob" 10.0))
```

This allows signatures to be _designated_ to a particular _authority_ as opposed to simply providing
an ambient authorization. This allows for instance a transaction to pay gas with one account and call
a smart contract to pay it for some service: without the capability restriction, the gas-paying account
would be wide open for the smart contract to steal from it.


### Guard types
Guards come in five flavors: keyset, keyset reference, module, pact, and user guards.

#### Keyset guards.
These are the classic pact keysets. Using the `keyset` type is the one instance where you can restrict a
guard subtype, otherwise the `guard` type obscures the implementation type to prevent developers from
engaging in guard-specific control flow, which would be against best practices. Again, it is better to
switch to `guard` unless there is a specific need to use keysets.

```lisp
(enforce-guard (read-keyset "keyset"))
```

#### Keyset reference guards
Keysets can be installed into the environment with `define-keyset`, but if you wanted to store a reference
to a defined keyset, you would need to use a `string` type. To make environment keysets interoperate
with concrete keysets and other guards, we introduce the "keyset reference guard" which indicates that a
defined keyset is used instead of a concrete keyset.

```lisp
(enforce-guard (keyset-ref-guard "foo"))

(update accounts user { "guard": (keyset-ref-guard "foo") })
```

#### Module guards {#module-guards}
Module guards are a special guard that when enforced will fail unless:

- the code calling the enforce was called from within the module, or

- module governance is granted to the current transaction.

This is for allowing a module or smart contract to autonomously "own" and manage some asset. As
such it is operationally identical to how module table access is guarded: only module code or
a transaction having module admin can directly write to a module tables, or upgrade the module,
so there is no need to use a module guard for these in-module operations.
A module guard is used to "project" module admin outside of the module (e.g. to own coins
in an external ledger), or "inject" module admin into an internal database representation (e.g.
to own an internally-managed asset alongside other non-module owners).

See [Module Governance](#module-governance) for more information about module admin management.

`create-module-guard` takes a `string` argument to allow naming the guard, to indicate the purpose or
role of the guard.

```lisp
(enforce-guard (create-module-guard "module-owned-asset"))
```

#### Pact guards

Pact guards are a special guard that will only pass if called in the specific `defpact` execution in
which the guard was created.

Imagine an escrow transaction where the funds need to be moved into an escrow account: if modeled as a two-step
pact, the funds can go into a special account named after the pact id, guarded by a pact guard.
This means that only code in a subsequent step of that particular pact execution (ie having the same
pact ID) can pass the guard.

```lisp
(defpact escrow (from to amount)
  (step (with-capability (ESCROW) (init-escrow from amount)))
  (step (with-capability (ESCROW) (complete-escrow to amount))))

(defun init-escrow (from amount)
  (require-capability (ESCROW))
  (create-account (pact-id) (create-pact-guard "escrow"))
  (transfer from (pact-id) amount))

(defun complete-escrow (to amount)
  (require-capability (ESCROW))
  (with-capability (USER_GUARD (pact-id)) ;; enforces guard on account (pact-id)
    (transfer (pact-id) to amount)))
```

Pact guards turn pact executions into autonomous processes that can own assets, and is a powerful
technique for trustless asset management within a multi-step operation.

#### User guards

User guards allow the user to design an arbitrary predicate function to enforce the guard, given some
initial data. For instance, a user guard could be designed to require two separate keysets to be enforced:

```lisp
(defun both-sign (ks1 ks2)
  (enforce-keyset ks1)
  (enforce-keyset ks2))

(defun install-both-guard ()
  (write guard-table "both"
    { "guard":
      (create-user-guard
        (both-sign (read-keyset "ks1) (read-keyset "ks2")))
    }))


(defun enforce-both-guard ()
  (enforce-guard (at "guard" (read guard-table "both"))))
```

NOTE: user-guard syntax is experimental and will most likely change in a near-term release
to support direct application of arguments (closure-style).

User guards can seem similar to capabilities but are different, namely in that they can be stored in the
database and passed around like plain data. Capabilities are in-module rights that can only be enforced
within the declaring module, and offer scoping and the other benefits mentioned above. User guards
are for implementing custom predicate logic that can't be expressed by other built-in guard types.

#### HTLC guard example

The following example shows how a "hash timelock" guard can be made, to implement atomic swaps.

```lisp

(create-hashlock-guard (secret-hash timeout signer-ks)
  (create-user-guard (enforce-hashlock secret-hash timeout signer-ks)))

(defun enforce-hashlock (secret-hash timeout signer-ks)
  (enforce-one [
    (enforce (= (hash (read-msg "secret")) secret-hash))
    (and
      (enforce-keyset signer-ks)
      (enforce (> (at "block-time" (chain-data)) timeout) "Timeout not passed"))
      ]))
```

Generalized Module Governance {#module-governance}
---

Before Pact 3.0, module upgrade and administration was governed by a defined keyset that is
referenced in the module definition. With Pact 3.0, this `string` value can alternately be an
unqualified bareword that references a `defcap` within the module body. This `defcap` is the
_module governance capability_.

With the introduction of the governance capability syntax, Pact modules now support
_generalized module governance_, allowing for module authors to design any governance scheme
they wish. Examples include tallying a stakeholder vote on an upgrade hash, or enforcing
more than one keyset.

### Keysets vs governance functions

To illustrate, let's consider a module governed by a keyset:

```lisp
(module foo 'foo-keyset ...)
```

This indicates that if a user tried to upgrade the module, or directly write to the module
tables, `'foo-keyset` would be enforced on the transaction signature set.

This can be directly implemented in a governance capability as follows:

```lisp
(module foo GOVERNANCE
  ...
  (defcap GOVERNANCE ()
    (enforce-keyset 'foo-keyset))
  ...
)
```

Note the capability can have whatever name desired; GOVERNANCE is a good idiomatic name however.

### Governance capability details

As a `defcap`, the governance function cannot be called directly by user code. It is only
invoked in the following circumstances:

- A module upgrade is being attempted
- Module tables are being directly accessed outside the module code
- A [module guard](#module-guards) for this module is being enforced.

Like any other capability, the governance capability can only be invoked within the declaring
module with `with-capability` etc. Given that module code already has elevated module admin,
there is never any need to acquire this particular capability. Using `require-capability` is
useful however to protect some admin-only capability:

```lisp
(defun deactivate-user (user)
  "Deactivate USER. Requires module admin."
  (require-capability (GOVERNANCE))
  (update users user { "active": false }))
```

#### Capability scope

Since module governance is acquired automatically for upgrades and external table writes,
this means that the module governance capability **stays in scope for the rest of the
calling transaction**. This is unlike "user" capabilities, which can only be acquired in
a fixed scope specified by the body of `with-capability`.

This may sound worrisome, but the rationale is that a governance capability once granted
should not be based on some transient fact that can become false during a single transaction.
This is important especially in module upgrades, _which can change the governance capability
itself_: if the module admin was tested again this could cause the upgrade to fail, for instance
when migrating data with direct table rights.

#### Capability risks

Also, this means that, when initially installing a module, _the governance function is not
invoked_. This is different behavior than when a keyset is specified: the keyset must be defined
and it is enforced, to ensure that the keyset actually exists.

Module governance is therefore more "risky" as it can mean that the module cannot be upgraded
if there is a bug in the governance capability. Clearly, care must be taken when implementing
module capabilities, and using the Pact formal verification system is highly recommended here.

### Example: stakeholder upgrade vote

In the following code, a module can be upgraded based on a vote. An upgrade is designed as a Pact
transaction, and its hash and code are distributed to stakeholders, who vote for the upgrade.
Once the upgrade is sent in, the vote is tallied in the governance capability, and if a simple
majority is found, the code is upgraded.

```lisp
(module govtest count-votes
  "Demonstrate programmable governance showing votes \
 \ for upgrade transaction hashes"
  (defschema vote
    vote-hash:string)

  (deftable votes:{vote})

  (defun vote-for-hash (user hsh)
    "Register a vote for a particular transaction hash"
    (write votes user { "vote-hash": hsh })
  )

  (defcap count-votes ()
    "Governance capability to tally votes for the upgrade hash".
    (let* ((h (tx-hash))
           (tally (fold (do-count h)
                        { "for": 0, "against": 0 }
                        (keys votes)))
          )
      (enforce (> (at 'for tally) (at 'against tally))
               (format "vote result: {}, {}" [h tally])))
  )

  (defun do-count (hsh tally u)
    "Add to TALLY if U has voted for HSH"
    (bind tally { "for" := f, "against" := a }
      (with-read votes u { 'vote-hash := v }
        (if (= v hsh)
            { "for": (+ 1 f), "against": a }
          { "for": f, "against": (+ 1 a) })))
  )
```

Interfaces {#interfaces}
---

An interface, as defined in Pact, is a collection of models used for formal verification, constant definitions, and typed function signatures. When a module issues an [implements](#implements), then that module is said to 'implement' said interface, and must provide an implementation . This allows for abstraction in a similar sense to Java's interfaces, Scala's traits, Haskell's typeclasses or OCaML's signatures. Multiple interfaces may be implemented in a given module, allowing for an expressive layering of behaviors.

Interfaces are declared using the `interface` keyword, and providing a name for the interface. Since interfaces cannot be upgraded, and no function implementations exist in an interface aside from constant data, there is no notion of governance that need be applied. Multiple interfaces may be implemented by a single module. If there are conflicting function names among multiple interfaces, then the two interfaces are incompatible, and the user must either inline the code they want, or redefine the interfaces to the point that the conflict is resolved.

Constants declared in an interface can be accessed directly by their fully qualified name `namespace.interface.const`, and so, they do not have the same naming constraints as function signatures.

Additionally, interfaces my make use of module declarations, admitting use of the [use](pact-functions.html#use) keyword, allowing interfaces to import members of other modules. This allows interface signatures to be defined in terms of table types defined in an imported module.

#### Example: Declaring and implementing an interface

```lisp
(interface my-interface
    (defun hello-number:string (number:integer)
      @doc "Return the string \"Hello, $number!\" when given a string"
      	)

    (defconst SOME_CONSTANT 3)
)

(module my-module (read-keyset 'my-keyset)
    (implements my-interface)

    (defun hello-number:string (number:integer)
        (format "Hello, {}!" [number]))

    (defun square-three ()
        (* my-interface.SOME_CONSTANT my-interface.SOME_CONSTANT))
)
```

### Declaring models in an interface

[Formal verification](pact-properties.html) is implemented at multiple levels within an interface in order to provide an extra level of security. Models may be declared either within the body of the interface or at the function level in the same way that one would declare them in a module, with the exception that not all models are applicable to an interface. Indeed, since there is no abstract notion of tables for interfaces, abstract table invariants cannot be declared. However, if an interface imports table schema and types from a module via the [use](pact-functions.html#use) keyword, then the interface can define body and function models that apply directly to the concrete table type. Otherwise, all properties are candidates for declaration in an interface.

When models are declared in an interface, they are appeneded to the list of models present in the implementing module at the level of declaration: body-level models are appended to body-level models, and function-level models are appended to function-level models. This allows users to extend the constraints of an interface with models applicable to specific business logic and implementation.

Declaring models shares the same syntax with modules:

#### Example: declaring models, tables, and importing modules in an interface

```lisp
(interface coin-sig

  "Coin Contract Abstract Interface Example"

  (use acct-module)

  (defun transfer:string (from:string to:string amount:integer)
    @doc   "Transfer money between accounts"
    @model [(property (row-enforced accounts "ks" from))
            (property (> amount 0))
            (property (= 0 (column-delta accounts "balance")))
            ]
  )
)
```



Computational Model {#computation}
---

Here we cover various aspects of Pact's approach to computation.

### Turing-Incomplete {#turingincomplete}
Pact is turing-incomplete, in that there is no recursion (recursion is detected before execution
and results in an error) and no ability to loop indefinitely. Pact does support operation on
list structures via [map](pact-functions.html#map), [fold](pact-functions.html#fold) and [filter](pact-functions.html#filter), but since there is no ability
to define infinite lists, these are necessarily bounded.

Turing-incompleteness allows Pact module loading to resolve all references in advance, meaning that
instead of addressing functions in a lookup table, the function definition is directly injected (or "inlined")
into the callsite. This is an example of the performance advantages of a Turing-incomplete language.

### Single-assignment Variables {#variables}

Pact allows variable declarations in [let expressions](#let) and [bindings](#bindings). Variables are
immutable: they cannot be re-assigned, or modified in-place.

A common variable declaration
occurs in the [with-read](pact-functions.html#with-read) function, assigning variables to column values by name. The
[bind](pact-functions.html#bind) function offers this same functionality for objects.

Module-global constant values can be declared with [defconst](#defconst).

### Data Types {#datatypes}

Pact code can be explicitly typed, and is always strongly-typed under the hood as the native
functions perform strict type checking as indicated in their documented type signatures.

Pact's supported types are:

- [Strings](#strings)
- [Integers](#integers)
- [Decimals](#decimals)
- [Booleans](#booleans)
- [Time values](#time)
- [Keysets](#keysets) and [Guards](#guards)
- [Lists](#lists)
- [Objects](#objects)
- [Function](#defun), [pact](#defpact), and [capability](#defcap) definitions
- [Tables](#deftable)
- [Schemas](#defschema)


### Performance {#performance}

Pact is designed to maximize the performance of [transaction execution](#transaction-execution), penalizing
queries and module definition in favor of fast recording of business events on the blockchain.
Some tips for fast execution are:

#### Single-function transactions {#singlefunctiontx}
Design transactions so they can be executed with a single function call.

#### Call with references instead of `use` {#usereferences}
When calling module functions in transactions, use [reference syntax](#references) instead of importing
the module with [use](#use). When defining modules that reference other module functions, `use` is
fine, as those references will be inlined at module definition time.

#### Hardcoded arguments vs. message values {#argsvmsgs}
A transaction can encode values directly into the transactional code:

```
(accounts.transfer "Acct1" "Acct2" 100.00)
```
or it can read values from the message JSON payload:

```
(defun transfer-msg ()
  (transfer (read-msg "from") (read-msg "to")
            (read-decimal "amount")))
...
(accounts.transfer-msg)
```
The latter will execute slightly faster, as there is less code to interpret at transaction time.

#### Types as necessary
With table schemas, Pact will be strongly typed for most use cases, but functions that do not
use the database might still need types. Use the [typecheck](typecheck) REPL function to add
the necessary types. There is a small cost for type enforcement at runtime, and too many type
signatures can harm readability. However types can help document an API, so this is a judgement call.

### Control Flow {#controlflow}
Pact supports conditionals via [if](pact-functions.html#if), bounded looping, and of course function application.

#### "If" considered harmful {#evilif}
Consider avoiding `if` wherever possible: every branch makes code harder to understand and more
prone to bugs. The best practice is to put "what am I doing" code in the front-end, and "validate
this transaction which I intend to succeed" code in the smart contract.

Pact's original design left out `if` altogether (and looping), but it was decided that users should
be able to judiciously use these features as necessary.

#### Use enforce {#use-the-enforce-luke}
"If" should never be used to enforce business logic invariants: instead, [enforce](pact-functions.html#enforce) is
the right choice, which will fail the transaction.

Indeed, failure is the only *non-local exit* allowed by Pact. This reflects Pact's emphasis on
*totality*.

Note that [enforce-one](pact-functions.html#enforce-one) (added in Pact 2.3) allows for testing a list of enforcements such that
if any pass, the whole expression passes. This is the sole example in Pact of "exception catching"
in that a failed enforcement simply results in the next test being executed, short-circuiting
on success.

#### Use built-in keyset predicates
The built-in keyset functions [keys-all](pact-functions.html#keys-all), [keys-any](pact-functions.html#keys-any), [keys-2](pact-functions.html#keys-2)
are hardcoded in the interpreter to execute quickly. Custom keysets require runtime resolution
which is slower.

### Functional Concepts {#fp}

Pact includes the functional-programming "greatest hits": [map](pact-functions.html#map), [fold](pact-functions.html#fold) and [filter](pact-functions.html#filter).
These all employ [partial application](#partial-application), where the list item is appended onto the application
arguments in order to serially execute the function.

```lisp
(map (+ 2) [1 2 3])
(fold (+) "" ["Concatenate" " " "me"])
```

Pact also has [compose](pact-functions.html#compose), which allows "chaining" applications in a functional style.

### Pure execution {#pure}
In certain contexts Pact can guarantee that computation is "pure", which simply means
that the database state will not be modified. Currently, `enforce`, `enforce-one`
and keyset predicate evaluation are all executed in a pure context. [defconst](#defconst)
memoization is also pure.

### LISP {#lisp}

Pact's use of LISP syntax is intended to make the code reflect its
runtime representation directly, allowing contract authors focus
directly on program execution. Pact code is stored in human-readable
form on the ledger, such that the code can be directly verified, but
the use of LISP-style [s-expression syntax](#sexp) allows this
code to execute quickly.

### Message Data {#messagedata}

Pact expects code to arrive in a message with a JSON payload and signatures. Message data
is read using [read-msg](pact-functions.html#read-msg) and related functions. While signatures are not directly
readable or writable, they are evaluated as part of [keyset predicate](#keysetpredicates)
enforcement.

#### JSON support {#json}

Values returned from Pact transactions are expected to be directly represented as JSON
values.

When reading values from a message via [read-msg](pact-functions.html#read-msg), Pact coerces JSON types
as follows:

- String -> `string`
- Number -> `decimal`
- Boolean -> `bool`
- Object -> `object`
- Array -> `list`

Integer values are represented as objects and read using [read-integer](pact-functions.html#read-integer).


Confidentiality {#confidentiality}
---

Pact is designed to be used in a *confidentiality-preserving* environment, where messages
are only visible to a subset of participants. This has significant implications for
smart contract execution.

### Entities
An *entity* is a business participant that is able or not able to see a confidential message.
An entity might be a company, a group within a company, or an individual.

### Disjoint Databases {#disjointdbs}
Pact smart contracts operate on messages organized by a blockchain, and serve to produce a
database of record, containing results of transactional executions. In a confidential environment,
different entities execute different transactions, meaning the resulting databases are now
*disjoint*.

This does not affect Pact execution; however, database data can no longer enact a "two-sided
transaction", meaning we need a new concept to handle enacting a single transaction over
multiple disjoint datasets.

### Confidential Pacts {#confidential-pacts}

An important feature for confidentiality in Pact is the ability to orchestrate disjoint
transactions in sequence to be executed by targeted entities. This is described in the next section.

Asynchronous Transaction Automation with "Pacts" {#pacts}
---

"Pacts" are multi-stage sequential transactions that are defined as a single body of code called
a [pact](#defpact). Defining a multi-step interaction as a pact ensures that transaction participants will
enact an agreed sequence of operations, and offers a special "execution scope" that can be used
to create and manage data resources only during the lifetime of a given multi-stage interaction.

Pacts are a form of *coroutine*, which is a function that has multiple exit and re-entry points. Pacts
are composed of [steps](#step) such that only a single step is executed in a given blockchain transaction.
Steps can only be executed in strict sequential order.

A pact is defined with arguments, similarly to function definition. However, arguments values are only
evaluated in the execution of the initial step, after which those values are available unchanged to subsequent steps.
To share new values
with subsequent steps, a step can [yield](pact-functions.html#yield) values which the subsequent step can recover using
the special [resume](pact-functions.html#resume) binding form.

Pacts are designed to run in one of two different contexts, private and public. A private pact is
indicated by each step identifying a single entity to execute the step, while public steps do
not have entity indicators. A pact can only be uniformly public or private: if some steps
has entity indicators and others do not, this results in an error at load time.

### Public Pacts
Public pacts are comprised of steps that can only execute in strict sequence. Any enforcement of who can execute a step
happens within the code of the step expression. All steps are "manually" initiated by some participant
in the transaction with CONTINUATION commands sent into the blockchain.

### Private Pacts
Private pacts are comprised of steps that execute in sequence where each step only executes on entity
nodes as selected by the provided 'entity' argument in the step; other entity nodes "skip" the step.
Private pacts are executed automatically by the blockchain platform after the initial step is sent
in, with the executing entity's node automatically sending the CONTINUATION command for the next step.

### Failures, Rollbacks and Cancels

Failure handling is dramatically different in public and private pacts.

In public pacts, a rollback expression is specified to indicate that the pact can be "cancelled" at
this step with a participant sending in a CANCEL message before the next step is executed. Once the last
step of a pact has been executed, the pact will be finished and cannot be rolled back. Failures
in public steps are no different than a failure in a non-pact transaction: all changes are rolled back.
Pacts can therefore only be canceled explicitly and should be modeled to offer all necessary cancel options.

In private pacts, the sequential execution of steps is automated by the blockchain platform itself. A failure
results in a ROLLBACK message being sent from the executing entity node which will trigger any rollback expression
specified in the previous step, to be executed by that step's entity. This failure will then "cascade" to the
previous step as a new ROLLBACK transaction, completing when the first step is rolled back.

### Yield and Resume

A step can yield values to the following step using [yield](pact-functions.html#yield) and [resume](pact-functions.html#resume). In public,
this is an unforgeable value, as it is maintained within the blockchain pact scope. In private, this is
simply a value sent with a RESUME message from the executed entity.

### Pact execution scope and `pact-id`

Every time a pact is initiated, it is given a unique ID which is retrievable using the [pact-id](pact-functions.html#pact-id)
function, which will return the ID of the currently executing pact, or fail if not running within a pact
scope. This mechanism can thus be used to guard access to resources, analogous to the use of keysets and
signatures. One typical use of this is to create escrow accounts that can only be used within the context
of a given pact, eliminating the need for a trusted third party for many use-cases.

### Testing pacts

Pacts
can be tested in repl scripts using the [env-entity](pact-functions.html#env-entity), [env-step](pact-functions.html#env-step)
and [pact-state](pact-functions.html#pact-state) repl functions to simulate pact executions.

It is also possible to simulate pact execution in the pact server API by formatting [continuation Request](#request-yaml)
yaml files into API requests with a `cont` payload.

Dependency Management {#dependency-management}
---
Pact supports a number of features to manage a module's dependencies on other Pact modules.

### Module Hashes
Once loaded, a Pact module is associated with a hash computed from the module's source code text.
This module hash uniquely identifies the version of the module. Hashes are base64url-encoded
BLAKE2 256-bit hashes.
Module hashes can be examined with [describe-module](pact-functions.html#describe-module):

```
pact> (at "hash" (describe-module 'accounts))
"ZHD9IZg-ro1wbx7dXi3Fr-CVmA-Pt71Ov9M1UNhzAkY"
```

### Pinning module versions with `use`
The [use](#use) special form allows
a module hash to be specified, in order to pin the dependency version. When
used within a module declaration, it introduces the dependency
hash value into the module's hash.
This allows a "dependency-only" upgrade to push the upgrade to the module version.

### Inlined Dependencies: "No Leftpad"
When a module is loaded, all references to foreign modules are resolved, and their code is
directly inlined. At this point, upstream definitions are permanent: the only way to upgrade
dependencies is to reload the original module.

This permanence is great for user code: once a module is loaded, an upstream provider cannot change what code
is executed within. However, this creates a big problem
for upstream developers, as they cannot upgrade the downstream code themselves in order to address an exploit, or to
introduce new features.

### Blessing hashes
A trade-off is needed to balance these opposing interests. Pact offers the ability for upstream
code to break downstream dependent code at runtime. Table access is guarded to enforce
that the module hash of the inlined dependency either matches the runtime version, or
is in a set of "blessed" hashes, as specified by [bless](#bless) in the module declaration:

```lisp
(module provider 'keyset
  (bless "ZHD9IZg-ro1wbx7dXi3Fr-CVmA-Pt71Ov9M1UNhzAkY")
  (bless "bctSHEz4N5Y1XQaic6eOoBmjty88HMMGfAdQLPuIGMw")
  ...
)
```

Dependencies with these hashes will continue to function after the module is loaded.
Unrecognized hashes will cause the transaction to fail. However, "pure" code that does
not access the database is unaffected. This prevents a "leftpad situation" where trivial
utility functions can harm downstream code stability.

### Phased upgrades with "v2" modules
Upstream providers can use the bless mechanism to phase in an important upgrade, by renaming
the upgraded module to indicate the new version, and replacing the old module with a new,
empty module that only blesses the last version (and whatever earlier versions desired).
New clients will
fail to import the "v1" code, requiring them to use the new version,
while existing users can continue to use the old version,
presumably up to some advertised time limit. The "empty" module can offer migration
functions to handle migrating user data to the new module, for the user to self-upgrade
in the time window.


Syntax
======

Literals {#literals}
--------

### Strings {#strings}

String literals are created with double-ticks:

```
pact> "a string"
"a string"
```

Strings also support multiline by putting a backslash before and after whitespace (not interactively).

```lisp
(defun id (a)
  "Identity function. \
  \Argument is returned."
  a)
```

### Symbols {#symbols}

Symbols are string literals representing some unique item in the runtime, like a function or a table name.
Their representation internally is simply a string literal so their usage is idiomatic.

Symbols are created with a preceding tick, thus they do not support whitespace nor multiline syntax.

```
pact> 'a-symbol
"a-symbol"
```

### Integers {#integers}

Integer literals are unbounded, and can be positive or negative.

```
pact> 12345
12345
pact> -922337203685477580712387461234
-922337203685477580712387461234
```

### Decimals {#decimals}

Decimal literals have potentially unlimited precision.

```
pact> 100.25
100.25
pact> -356452.234518728287461023856582382983746
-356452.234518728287461023856582382983746
```

### Booleans {#booleans}

Booleans are represented by `true` and `false` literals.

```
pact> (and true false)
false
```

### Lists {#lists}

List literals are created with brackets, and optionally separated with commas.
Uniform literal lists are given a type in parsing.
```
pact> [1 2 3]
[1 2 3]
pact> [1,2,3]
[1 2 3]
pact> (typeof [1 2 3])
"[integer]"
pact> (typeof [1 2 true])
"list"
```

### Objects {#objects}

Objects are dictionaries, created with curly-braces specifying key-value pairs
using a colon `:`.
For certain applications (database updates), keys must be strings.

```
pact> { "foo": (+ 1 2), "bar": "baz" }
{ "foo": (+ 1 2), "bar": "baz" }
```

### Bindings {#bindings}
Bindings are dictionary-like forms, also created with curly braces, to bind
database results to variables using the `:=` operator.
They are used in [with-read](pact-functions.html#with-read), [with-default-read](pact-functions.html#with-default-read),
[bind](pact-functions.html#bind) and [resume](pact-functions.html#resume) to assign variables to named columns in a row, or values in an object.

```lisp
(defun check-balance (id)
  (with-read accounts id { "balance" := bal }
    (enforce (> bal 0) (format "Account in overdraft: {}" [bal]))))
```

Type specifiers
-----

Types can be specified in syntax with the colon `:` operator followed by
a type literal or user type specification.

### Type literals

- `string`
- `integer`
- `decimal`
- `bool`
- `time`
- `keyset`
- `list`, or `[type]` to specify the list type
- `object`, which can be further typed with a schema
- `table`, which can be further typed with a schema

### Schema type literals

A schema defined with [defschema](#defschema) is referenced by name enclosed in curly braces.

```lisp
table:{accounts}
object:{person}
```

### What can be typed

#### Function arguments and return types
```lisp
(defun prefix:string (pfx:string str:string) (+ pfx str))
```

#### Let variables
```lisp
(let ((a:integer 1) (b:integer 2)) (+ a b))
```

#### Tables and objects
Tables and objects can only take a schema type literal.
```lisp
(deftable accounts:{account})

(defun get-order:{order} (id) (read orders id))
```

#### Consts
```lisp
(defconst PENNY:decimal 0.1)
```


Special forms {#special-forms}
---

### Docs and Metadata
Many special forms like [defun](#defun) accept optional documentation strings,
in the following form:

```lisp
(defun average (a b)
  "take the average of a and b"
  (/ (+ a b) 2))
```

Alternately, users can specify metadata using a special `@`-prefix syntax.
Supported metadata fields are `@doc` to provide a documentation string, and `@model`
that can be used by Pact tooling to verify the correctness of the implementation:

```lisp
(defun average (a b)
  @doc   "take the average of a and b"
  @model (property (= (+ a b) (* 2 result)))
  (/ (+ a b) 2))
```

Indeed, a bare docstring like `"foo"` is actually just a short form for `@doc "foo"`.

Specific information on *Properties* can be found in [The Pact Property Checking System](pact-properties.html).

### bless {#bless}
```
(bless HASH)
```

Within a module declaration, bless a previous version of that module as identified by HASH.
See [Dependency management](#dependency-management) for a discussion of the blessing mechanism.

```lisp
(module provider 'keyset
  (bless "ZHD9IZg-ro1wbx7dXi3Fr-CVmA-Pt71Ov9M1UNhzAkY")
  (bless "bctSHEz4N5Y1XQaic6eOoBmjty88HMMGfAdQLPuIGMw")
  ...
)
```


### defun {#defun}

```lisp
(defun NAME ARGLIST [DOC-OR-META] BODY...)
```

Define NAME as a function, accepting ARGLIST arguments, with optional DOC-OR-META.
Arguments are in scope for BODY, one or more expressions.

```lisp
(defun add3 (a b c) (+ a (+ b c)))

(defun scale3 (a b c s)
  "multiply sum of A B C times s"
  (* s (add3 a b c)))
```

### defcap {#defcap}

```lisp
(defcap NAME ARGLIST [DOC] BODY...)
```

Define NAME as a capability, specified using ARGLIST arguments, with optional DOC.
A `defcap` models a capability token which will be stored in the environment to represent
some ability or right. Code in BODY is only called within special capability-related
functions `with-capability` and `compose-capability` when the token as parameterized
by the arguments supplied is not found in the environment. When executed, arguments are
in scope for BODY, one or more expressions.


```lisp
(defcap USER_GUARD (user)
  "Enforce user account guard
  (with-read accounts user
    { "guard": guard }
    (enforce-guard guard)))
```

### defconst {#defconst}
```lisp
(defconst NAME VALUE [DOC-OR-META])
```

Define NAME as VALUE, with option DOC-OR-META. Value is evaluated upon module load and "memoized".

```lisp
(defconst COLOR_RED="#FF0000" "Red in hex")
(defconst COLOR_GRN="#00FF00" "Green in hex")
(defconst PI 3.14159265 "Pi to 8 decimals")
```

### defpact {#defpact}

```
(defpact NAME ARGLIST [DOC-OR-META] STEPS...)
```


Define NAME as a _pact_, a computation comprised of multiple steps that occur
in distinct transactions.
Identical to [defun](#defun) except body must be comprised of [steps](#step) to be
executed in strict sequential order. Steps must uniformly be "public" (no entity indicator)
or "private" (with entity indicator). With private steps, failures result in a reverse-sequence
"rollback cascade".

```lisp
(defpact payment (payer payer-entity payee
                  payee-entity amount)
  (step-with-rollback payer-entity
    (debit payer amount)
    (credit payer amount))
  (step payee-entity
    (credit payee amount)))
```

### defschema {#defschema}

```
(defschema NAME [DOC-OR-META] FIELDS...)
```

Define NAME as a _schema_, which specifies a list of FIELDS. Each field
is in the form `FIELDNAME[:FIELDTYPE]`.

```lisp
(defschema accounts
  "Schema for accounts table".
  balance:decimal
  amount:decimal
  ccy:string
  data)
```

### deftable {#deftable}

```
(deftable NAME[:SCHEMA] [DOC-OR-META])
```

Define NAME as a _table_, used in database functions. Note the
table must still be created with [create-table](pact-functions.html#create-table).

### let {#let}

```
(let (BINDPAIR [BINDPAIR [...]]) BODY)
```

Bind variables in BINDPAIRs to be in scope over BODY. Variables
within BINDPAIRs cannot refer to previously-declared variables in
the same let binding; for this use [let\*](#letstar).

```lisp
(let ((x 2)
      (y 5))
  (* x y))
> 10
```

### let&#42; {#letstar}

```
(let* (BINDPAIR [BINDPAIR [...]]) BODY)
```

Bind variables in BINDPAIRs to be in scope over BODY. Variables
can reference previously declared BINDPAIRS in the same let.
`let*` is expanded at compile-time to nested `let` calls for
each BINDPAIR; thus `let` is preferred where possible.

```lisp
(let* ((x 2)
       (y (* x 10)))
  (+ x y))
> 22
```

### step {#step}
```
(step EXPR)
(step ENTITY EXPR)
```

Define a step within a [defpact](#defpact), such that any prior steps will be
executed in prior transactions, and later steps in later transactions.
Including an ENTITY argument indicates that this step is intended for confidential
transactions. Therefore, only the ENTITY would execute the step, and other
participants would "skip" it.

### step-with-rollback {#step-with-rollback}
```
(step-with-rollback EXPR ROLLBACK-EXPR)
(step-with-rollback ENTITY EXPR ROLLBACK-EXPR)
```

Define a step within a [defpact](#defpact) similarly to [step](#step) but specifying ROLLBACK-EXPR.
With ENTITY, ROLLBACK-EXPR will only be executed upon failure of a subsequent step, as part of a reverse-sequence "rollback
cascade" going back from the step that failed to the first step. Without ENTITY,
ROLLBACK-EXPR functions as a "cancel function" to be explicitly executed by a participant.

### use {#use}
```
(use MODULE)
(use MODULE HASH)
(use MODULE IMPORTS)
(use MODULE HASH IMPORTS)
```

Import an existing MODULE into a namespace. Can only be issued at the top-level, or within a module
declaration. MODULE can be a string, symbol or bare atom. With HASH, validate that the imported module's
hash matches HASH, failing if not. Use [describe-module](pact-functions.html#describe-module) to query for the
hash of a loaded module on the chain.

An optional list of IMPORTS consisting of function, constant, and schema names may be supplied. When this explicit import list is present, only those names will be made available for use in the module body. If no list is supplied, then every name in the imported module will be brought into scope. When two modules are defined in the same transaction, all names will be in scope for all modules, and import behavior will be defaulted to the entire module.

```lisp
(use accounts)
(transfer "123" "456" 5 (time "2016-07-22T11:26:35Z"))
"Write succeeded"
```
```lisp
(use accounts "ToV3sYFMghd7AN1TFKdWk_w00HjUepVlqKL79ckHG_s")
(transfer "123" "456" 5 (time "2016-07-22T11:26:35Z"))
"Write succeeded"
```
```lisp
(use accounts [ transfer example-fun ])
(transfer "123" "456" 5 (time "2016-07-22T11:26:35Z"))
"Write succeeded"
```
```lisp
(use accounts "ToV3sYFMghd7AN1TFKdWk_w00HjUepVlqKL79ckHG_s" [ transfer example-fun ])
(transfer "123" "456" 5 (time "2016-07-22T11:26:35Z"))
"Write succeeded"
```

### module {#module}
```
(module NAME KEYSET-OR-GOVERNANCE [DOC-OR-META] BODY...)
```

Define and install module NAME, with module admin governed by KEYSET-OR-GOVERNANCE, with optional DOC-OR-META.

If KEYSET-OR-GOVERNANCE is a string, it references a keyset that has been installed with `define-keyset`
that will be tested whenever module admin is required. If KEYSET-OR-GOVERNANCE is an unqualified atom, it
references a `defcap` capability which will be acquired if module admin is requested.

BODY is composed of definitions that will be scoped in the module. Valid productions in a module include:

- [defun](#defun)
- [defpact](#defpact)
- [defcap](#defcap)
- [deftable](#deftable)
- [defschema](#defschema)
- [defconst](#defconst)
- [implements](#implements)
- [use](#use)
- [bless](#bless)

```lisp
(module accounts 'accounts-admin
  "Module for interacting with accounts"

  (defun create-account (id bal)
   "Create account ID with initial balance BAL"
   (insert accounts id { "balance": bal }))

  (defun transfer (from to amount)
   "Transfer AMOUNT from FROM to TO"
   (with-read accounts from { "balance": fbal }
    (enforce (<= amount fbal) "Insufficient funds")
     (with-read accounts to { "balance": tbal }
      (update accounts from { "balance": (- fbal amount) })
      (update accounts to { "balance": (+ tbal amount) }))))
)
```

Expressions {#expression}
---

Expressions may be [literals](#literals), atoms, s-expressions, or references.


### Atoms {#atom}

Atoms are non-reserved barewords starting with a letter or allowed symbol, and containing letters,
digits and allowed symbols. Allowed symbols are `%#+-_&$@<>=?*!|/`. Atoms must
resolve to a variable bound by a [defun](#defun), [defpact](#defpact), [binding](#bindings) form,
or to symbols imported into the namespace with [use](#use).

### S-expressions {#sexp}

S-expressions are formed with parentheses, with the first atom determining if
the expression is a [special form](#special-forms) or a function application, in
which case the first atom must refer to a definition.

#### Partial application {#partialapplication}
An application with less than the required arguments is in some contexts a valid
*partial application* of the function. However, this is only supported in
Pact's [functional-style functions](#functional-concepts); anywhere else this will result in a
runtime error.

### References {#references}

References are multiple atoms joined by a dot `.` that directly resolve to definitions found
in other modules.

```
pact> accounts.transfer
"(defun accounts.transfer (src,dest,amount,date) \"transfer AMOUNT from
SRC to DEST\")"
pact> transfer
Eval failure:
transfer<EOF>: Cannot resolve transfer
pact> (use 'accounts)
"Using \"accounts\""
pact> transfer
"(defun accounts.transfer (src,dest,amount,date) \"transfer AMOUNT from
SRC to DEST\")"
```

References are preferred over `use` for transactions, as references resolve faster.
However, when defining a module, `use` is preferred for legibility.

Time formats
===

Pact leverages the Haskell [thyme library](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/thyme) for fast
computation of time values. The [parse-time](pact-functions.html#parse-time) and [format-time](pact-functions.html#format-time)
functions accept format codes that derive from GNU `strftime` with some extensions, as follows:

`%%` - literal `"%"`

`%z` - RFC 822/ISO 8601:1988 style numeric time zone (e.g., `"-0600"` or `"+0100"`)

`%N` - ISO 8601 style numeric time zone (e.g., `"-06:00"` or `"+01:00"`) /EXTENSION/

`%Z` - timezone name

`%c` - The preferred calendar time representation for the current locale. As 'dateTimeFmt' `locale` (e.g. `%a %b %e %H:%M:%S %Z %Y`)

`%R` - same as `%H:%M`

`%T` - same as `%H:%M:%S`

`%X` - The preferred time of day representation for the current locale. As 'timeFmt' `locale` (e.g. `%H:%M:%S`)

`%r` - The complete calendar time using the AM/PM format of the current locale. As 'time12Fmt' `locale` (e.g. `%I:%M:%S %p`)

`%P` - day-half of day from ('amPm' `locale`), converted to lowercase, `"am"`, `"pm"`

`%p` - day-half of day from ('amPm' `locale`), `"AM"`, `"PM"`

`%H` - hour of day (24-hour), 0-padded to two chars, `"00"`–`"23"`

`%k` - hour of day (24-hour), space-padded to two chars, `" 0"`–`"23"`

`%I` - hour of day-half (12-hour), 0-padded to two chars, `"01"`–`"12"`

`%l` - hour of day-half (12-hour), space-padded to two chars, `" 1"`–`"12"`

`%M` - minute of hour, 0-padded to two chars, `"00"`–`"59"`

`%S` - second of minute (without decimal part), 0-padded to two chars, `"00"`–`"60"`

`%v` - microsecond of second, 0-padded to six chars, `"000000"`–`"999999"`. /EXTENSION/

`%Q` - decimal point and fraction of second, up to 6 second decimals, without trailing zeros.
       For a whole number of seconds, `%Q` produces the empty string. /EXTENSION/

`%s` - number of whole seconds since the Unix epoch. For times before
the Unix epoch, this is a negative number. Note that in `%s.%q` and `%s%Q`
the decimals are positive, not negative. For example, 0.9 seconds
before the Unix epoch is formatted as `"-1.1"` with `%s%Q`.

`%D` - same as `%m\/%d\/%y`

`%F` - same as `%Y-%m-%d`

`%x` - as 'dateFmt' `locale` (e.g. `%m\/%d\/%y`)

`%Y` - year, no padding.

`%y` - year of century, 0-padded to two chars, `"00"`–`"99"`

`%C` - century, no padding.

`%B` - month name, long form ('fst' from 'months' `locale`), `"January"`–`"December"`

`%b`, `%h` - month name, short form ('snd' from 'months' `locale`), `"Jan"`–`"Dec"`

`%m` - month of year, 0-padded to two chars, `"01"`–`"12"`

`%d` - day of month, 0-padded to two chars, `"01"`–`"31"`

`%e` - day of month, space-padded to two chars, `" 1"`–`"31"`

`%j` - day of year, 0-padded to three chars, `"001"`–`"366"`

`%G` - year for Week Date format, no padding.

`%g` - year of century for Week Date format, 0-padded to two chars, `"00"`–`"99"`

`%f` - century for Week Date format, no padding. /EXTENSION/

`%V` - week of year for Week Date format, 0-padded to two chars, `"01"`–`"53"`

`%u` - day of week for Week Date format, `"1"`–`"7"`

`%a` - day of week, short form ('snd' from 'wDays' `locale`), `"Sun"`–`"Sat"`

`%A` - day of week, long form ('fst' from 'wDays' `locale`), `"Sunday"`–`"Saturday"`

`%U` - week of year where weeks start on Sunday (as 'sundayStartWeek'), 0-padded to two chars, `"00"`–`"53"`

`%w` - day of week number, `"0"` (= Sunday) – `"6"` (= Saturday)

`%W` - week of year where weeks start on Monday (as 'Data.Thyme.Calendar.WeekdayOfMonth.mondayStartWeek'), 0-padded to two chars, `"00"`–`"53"`

Note: `%q` (picoseconds, zero-padded) does not work properly so not documented here.

## Default format and JSON serialization

The default format is a UTC ISO8601 date+time format: "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ", as accepted by the [time](pact-functions.html#id4)
function. While the time object internally supports up to microsecond resolution, values returned from the Pact
interpreter as JSON will be serialized with the default format. When higher resolution is desired, explicitly format
times with `%v` and related codes.

## Examples

### ISO8601

```
pact> (format-time "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%N" (time "2016-07-23T13:30:45Z"))
"2016-07-23T13:30:45+00:00"
```

### RFC822

```
pact> (format-time "%a, %_d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %Z" (time "2016-07-23T13:30:45Z"))
"Sat, 23 Jul 2016 13:30:45 UTC"
```

### YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.000000

```
pact> (format-time "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%v" (add-time (time "2016-07-23T13:30:45Z") 0.001002))
"2016-07-23 13:30:45.001002"
```


# Database Serialization Format

## IMPORTANT EXPERIMENTAL/BETA WARNING

This section documents the database serialization format starting with Pact 2.4.* versions. However, this
format is still in BETA as we are only recently starting to work with concrete RDBMS back-ends and deployments
that directly export this data.

As a result we make NO COMMITMENT TO BACKWARD-COMPATIBILITY of these formats and reserve the right to move
to improved formats in future versions. API stability in Pact prioritizes client-facing compatibility and
performance first, with backend export still being an experimental feature.

We do expect these formats to stabilize in the future at which time backward compatibility will be guaranteed.


## Key-Value Format with JSON values

Pact stores all values to the backing database in a two-column key-value structure with all values expressed as JSON.
This approach is motivated by transparency and portability:

_Transparency_: JSON is a human-readable format which allows visual verification of values.

_Portability_: JSON enjoys strong support in nearly every database backend at time of writing (2018). The key-value
structure allows using even non-RDBMS backends like RocksDB etc, and also keeps SQL DDL very straightforward,
with simple primary key structure. Indexing is not supported nor required.


### Integer

Integers are encoded as an JSON object with a single field "int" referring to a
Number value for non-large integers, or
a string for large values.

What is considered a "large integer"
in JSON/Javascript is subject to debate; we use the range `[-2^53 .. 2^53]` as specified
[here](http://blog.vjeux.com/2010/javascript/javascript-max_int-number-limits.html). For
large integers, we encode a JSON singleton object with the stringified integer value:

```javascript
/* small integers are just a number */
{ "int": 1 }
/* large integers are string */
{ "int": "1231289371891238912983712983712098908937"
}
```

### Decimal

Decimals are directly encoded to JSON scientific format, unless the mantissa is greater than
a safe JS integer, in which case it is encoded as an JSON object with key "decimal" referring to
the string representation.

```javascript
/* decimal with safe mantissa */
10.234
/* decimal with unsafe mantissa */
{ "decimal": "34985794739875934875348957394875349835.39587348953495875394534" }
```

### Boolean

Booleans are stored as JSON booleans.

### String

Strings are stored as JSON strings.

### Time

Times are stored in a JSON object with key "time" for second-resolution values, or "timep" for
microsecond-resolution values, as a ISO8601 UTC string (modified for high-resolution).

```javascript
/* second-resolution time */
{ "time": "2016-12-23T08:23:13Z"
/* microsecond-resolution time */
{ "timep": "2016-12-23T08:23:13.006032Z" }
```

### Keyset

Keysets use the built-in JSON representation.

```javascript
{ "keys": ["key1","key2"] /* public key string representations */
, "pred": "keys-all"      /* predicate function name */
}
```

## Module (User) Tables

NOTE/WARNING: This does not apply to Chainweb table backends, and may be discontinued.

For each module table specified in Pact code, two backend tables are created: the "data table" and the "transaction table".

### Column names

Names for all key value tables are simply **t_key** and **t_value**.

### User Data table

The data table supports CRUD-style access to the current table state.

- **Naming**: `USER_[module]_[table]`.
- **Key Format**: Keys are text/VARCHARs, and maximum length supported is backend-dependent.
- **Value format**: JSON object, with user-specified keys and codec-transformed values.

### User Transaction Table

The transaction table logs all updates to the table.

- **Naming**: `TX_[module]_[table]`
- **Key Format**: Keys are integers, using backend-specific BIGINT values, reflecting the transaction ID being recorded.
- **Value format**: JSON array of updates in a particular transaction.

The update format is a JSON object:

```javascript
{ "table": "name"  /* user-visible table name (not backend table name) */
, "key": "123"     /* update string key */
, "value": { ... } /* The new JSON row value. Entire row is captured. */
```

Note that the JSON row value uses the same encoding as found in the user data table.
