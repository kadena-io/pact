Pact Smart Contract Language Reference
===

This document is a reference for the Pact smart-contract language, designed for
correct, transactional execution on a [high-performance blockchain](http://kadena.io). For more
background, please see the [white paper](http://kadena.io/docs/Kadena-PactWhitepaper.pdf)
or the [pact home page](http://kadena.io/#pactModal).

Rest API
=======
As of version 2.1.0 Pact ships with a built-in HTTP server and SQLite backend. This allows for prototyping
blockchain applications with just the `pact` tool.

To start up the server issue `pact -s config.yaml`, with a suitable config.
The `pact-lang-api` JS library is [available via npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pact-lang-api) for web development.


`cmd` field and Payloads {#cmd-field-and-payloads}
---

Transactions sent into the blockchain must be hashed in order to ensure the received command is correct; this is also
the value that is signed with the required private keys. To ensure the JSON for the transaction matches byte-for-byte
with the value used to make the hash, the JSON must be *encoded* into the payload as a string
(i.e., ["stringified"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify)).
The `cmd` field supports two types of payloads: the `exec` payload and the `cont` payload.

### `exec` Payload {#exec-payload}

The `exec` payload holds the executable code and data as encoded strings.
The [send](#send), [private](#private), and [local](#local) endpoints support this payload type in the `cmd` field.
The format of the JSON to be encoded is as follows.

```javascript
{
  "nonce": "[nonce value, needs to be unique for every call]",
  "payload": {
    "exec": {
      "code": "[pact code to be executed]",
      "data": {
        /* arbitrary user data to accompany code */
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When assembling the message, this JSON should be "stringified" and provided for the `cmd` field.
If you inspect the output of the [request formatter in the pact tool](#api-request-formatter), you will see that the `"cmd"` field, along
with any code supplied, are a String of encoded, escaped JSON.

### `cont` Payload {#cont-payload}

The `cont` payload allows for continuing or rolling back [pacts](#pacts). This payload includes the following fields: the id of the pact involved,
whether to rollback or continue the pact, the step number, and any step data needed. These payload fields have special constraints:

- The pact id is equivalent to the id of the transaction where the pact was instantiated from.

- Only one pact can be instantiated per transaction.

- If the pact is being rolled back, the step number must correspond to step that just executed.

- If the pact is being continued, the step number must correspond to one more than the step that just executed.

Like the `exec` payload fields, the `cont` payload fields must also be encoded as strings. The [send](#send) endpoint
supports this payload type in the `cmd` field. The format of the JSON to be encoded is as follows.

```javascript
{
  "nonce": "[nonce value, needs to be unique for every call]",
  "payload": {
    "cont": {
      "txid": [transaction id where pact instantiated]
      "rollback": [true or false],
      "step": [step to be continued or rolled back, needs to be integer between 0 and (total number of steps - 1)]
      "data": {
        /* arbitrary user data to accompany step code */
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Endpoints
---

All endpoints are served from `api/v1`. Thus a `send` call would be sent to <http://localhost:8080/api/v1/send>, if running on `localhost:8080`.

### /send

Asynchronous submission of one or more *private* commands to the blockchain, using supplied address info
to securely encrypt, in order only to send and receive entities for reading.
See [cmd field format](#cmd-field-and-payloads) regarding the stringified JSON data.

Request JSON:

```javascript
{
  "cmds": [
  {
    "hash": "[blake2 hash in base16 of 'cmd' string value]",
    "sigs": [

	"addr": "[base16-format of address derived from public key]"

        /* optional field, defaults to ED25519, will support other curves as needed */
        "scheme": "ED25519 or ETH"
      }
    ]
    "cmd": "[stringified transaction JSON]"

}
```

Response JSON:

```
{
  "status": "success|failure",

        "data": /* data from Pact execution represented as JSON */
      },
      "txId": /* integer transaction id, for use in querying history etc */
    }

    },
    "txId": /* integer transaction id, for use in querying history etc */
  }
}
```

### /local

Blocking/sync call to send a command for non-transactional execution. In a blockchain
environment this would be a node-local "dirty read". Any database writes or changes
to the environment are rolled back. See [cmd field format](#cmd-field-and-payloads) regarding the stringified JSON data.

Request JSON:

```javascript
{
  "cmds": [
  {

    ]
    "cmd": "[stringified transaction JSON]"
  }
  // ... more commands
  ]
}
```

Response JSON:

```
{
  "status": "success|failure",
  "response": {
    "status": "success|failure",
    "data": /* data from Pact execution represented as JSON */
  }
}
```

API request formatter
---

As of Pact 2.2.3, the `pact` tool now accepts the `-a` option to format API request JSON,
using a YAML file describing the request. The output can then be used with a POST tool like
Postman or even piping into `curl`.

For instance, a yaml file called "apireq.yaml" with the following contents:

```
code: "(+ 1 2)"
data:
  name: Stuart
  language: Pact
keyPairs:
  - public: ba54b224d1924dd98403f5c751abdd10de6cd81b0121800bf7bdbdcfaec7388d
    secret: 8693e641ae2bbe9ea802c736f42027b03f86afe63cae315e7169c9c496c17332
```

can be fed into `pact` to obtain a valid API request:

```
$ pact -a tests/apireq.yaml -l
{"hash":"444669038ea7811b90934f3d65574ef35c82d5c79cedd26d0931fddf837cccd2c9cf19392bf62c485f33535983f5e04c3e1a06b6b49e045c5160a637db8d7331","sigs":[{"sig":"9097304baed4c419002c6b9690972e1303ac86d14dc59919bf36c785d008f4ad7efa3352ac2b8a47d0b688fe2909dbf392dd162457c4837bc4dc92f2f61fd20d","scheme":"ED25519","pubKey":"ba54b224d1924dd98403f5c751abdd10de6cd81b0121800bf7bdbdcfaec7388d","addr":"ba54b224d1924dd98403f5c751abdd10de6cd81b0121800bf7bdbdcfaec7388d"}],"cmd":"{\"address\":null,\"payload\":{\"exec\":{\"data\":{\"name\":\"Stuart\",\"language\":\"Pact\"},\"code\":\"(+ 1 2)\"}},\"nonce\":\"\\\"2017-09-27 19:42:06.696533 UTC\\\"\"}"}

```

Here's an example of piping into curl, hitting a pact server running on port 8080:

```
$ pact -a tests/apireq.yaml -l | curl -d @- http://localhost:8080/api/v1/local
{"status":"success","response":{"status":"success","data":3}}
```


### Request YAML file format {#request-yaml}
Request yaml files takes two forms. An *execution* Request yaml file describes the [exec](#exec-payload) payload.
Meanwhile, a *continuation* Request yaml file describes the [cont](#cont-payload) payload.

The execution Request yaml takes the following keys:

```yaml
  code: Transaction code
  codeFile: Transaction code file
  data: JSON transaction data
  dataFile: JSON transaction data file
  keyPairs: list of key pairs for signing (use pact -g to generate): [
    public: base 16 public key
    secret: base 16 secret key
    ]
  nonce: optional request nonce, will use current time if not provided
  from: entity name for addressing private messages
  to: entity names for addressing private messages
```

The continuation Request yaml takes the following keys:

```yaml
  type: "cont"
  txId: Integer transaction id of pact
  step: Integer next step of a pact
  rollback: Boolean for rollingback a pact
  data: JSON transaction data
  dataFile: JSON transaction data file
  keyPairs: list of key pairs for signing (use pact -g to generate): [
    public: base 16 public key
    secret: base 16 secret key
    ]
  nonce: optional request nonce, will use current time if not provided
  from: entity name for addressing private messages
  to: entity names for addressing private messages
```




Concepts {#concepts}
========

Execution Modes {#execmodes}
---

Pact is designed to be used in distinct *execution modes* to address
the performance requirements of rapid linear execution on a
blockchain. These are:

1. Contract definition.
2. Transaction execution.
3. Queries and local execution.

### Contract Definition {#definitionmode}

In this mode, a large amount of code is sent into the blockchain to
establish the smart contract, as comprised of code (modules), tables
(data), and keysets (authorization). This can also include "transactional"
(database-modifying) code, for instance to initialize data.

For a given smart contract, these should all be sent as a single message
into the blockchain, so that any error will rollback the entire smart contract
as a unit.

#### Keyset definition {#keysetdefinition}

[Keysets](#confidential-keysets) are customarily defined first, as they are used to specify
admin authorization schemes for modules and tables. Definition creates the keysets
in the runtime environment and stores their definition in the global keyset database.

#### Module declaration {#moduledeclaration}

[Modules](#module) contain the API and data definitions for smart contracts. They are comprised of:

- [functions](#defun)
- [schema](#defschema) definitions
- [table](#deftable) definitions
- ["pact"](#defpact) special functions
- [const](#defconst) values

When a module is declared, all references to native functions
or definitions from other modules are resolved. Resolution failure results in transaction rollback.

Modules can be re-defined as controlled by their admin keyset. Module versioning is not supported,
except by including a version sigil in the module name (e.g., "accounts-v1"). However,
*module hashes* are a powerful feature for ensuring code safety. When a module is imported with
[use](#use), the module hash can be specified, to tie code to a particular release.

As of Pact 2.2, `use` statements can be issued within a module declaration. This combined with
module hashes provides a high level of assurance, as updated module code will fail to import
if a dependent module has subsequently changed on the chain; this will also propagate changes
to the loaded modules' hash, protecting downstream modules from inadvertent changes on update.

Module names must be globally unique.


#### Table Creation {#tablecreation}

Tables are [created](pact-functions.html#create-table) at the same time as modules. While tables are *defined* in
modules, they are *created* "after" modules, so that the module may be redefined later without
having to necessarily re-create the table.

The relationship of modules to tables is important, as described in [Table Guards](#module-table-guards).

There is no restriction on how many tables may be created. Table names are namespaced with
the module name.

Tables can be typed with a [schema](#defschema).

### Transaction Execution {#transaction-execution}

"Transactions" refer to business events enacted on the blockchain, like a payment, a sale, or
a workflow step of a complex contractual agreement. A transaction is generally a single call to
a module function. However there is no limit on how many statements can be executed. Indeed,
the difference between "transactions" and "smart contract definition" is simply the *kind* of code
executed, not any actual difference in the code evaluation.

### Queries and Local Execution {#queries}

Querying data is generally not a business event, and can involve data payloads that could impact
performance, so querying is carried out as a *local execution* on the node receiving the message.
Historical queries use a *transaction ID* as a point of reference, to avoid any race
conditions and allow asynchronous query execution.

Transactional vs local execution is accomplished by targeting different API endpoints; pact code
has no ability to distinguish between transactional and local execution.

Database Interaction {#dbinteraction}
---

Pact presents a database metaphor reflecting the unique requirements of blockchain execution,
which can be adapted to run on different back-ends.

### Atomic execution {#atomicexecution}

A single message sent into the blockchain to be evaluated by Pact is *atomic*: the transaction
succeeds as a unit, or does not succeed at all, known as "transactions" in database literature.
There is no explicit support for rollback handling, except in [multi-step transactions](#pacts).

### Key-Row Model {#dbkeyrow}

Blockchain execution can be likened to OLTP (online transaction processing) database workloads,
which favor denormalized data written to a single table. Pact's data-access API reflects this
by presenting a *key-row* model, where a row of column values is accessed by a single key.

As a result, Pact does not support *joining* tables, which is more suited for an OLAP (online
analytical processing) database, populated from exports from the Pact database. This does not
mean Pact cannot *record* transactions using relational techniques -- for example, a Customer table whose keys
are used in a Sales table would involve the code looking up the Customer record before writing
to the Sales table.

### Queries and Performance {#queryperformance}

As of Pact 2.3, Pact offers a powerful query mechanism for selecting multiple rows from a table.
While visually similar to SQL, the [select](pact-functions.html#select) and [where](pact-functions.html#where) operations offer a
_streaming interface_ to a table, where the user provides filter functions, and then operates
on the rowset as a list data structure using [sort](pact-functions.html#sort) and other functions.

```lisp

;; the following selects Programmers with salaries >= 90000 and sorts by age descending

(reverse (sort ['age]
  (select 'employees ['first-name,'last-name,'age]
    (and? (where 'title (= "Programmer"))
          (where 'salary (< 90000))))))

;; the same query could be performed on a list with 'filter':

(reverse (sort ['age]
  (filter (and? (where 'title (= "Programmer"))
                (where 'salary (< 90000)))
          employees)))

```

In a transactional setting, Pact database interactions are optimized for single-row reads and writes,
meaning such queries can be slow and prohibitively expensive computationally. However, using the
[local](#local) execution capability, Pact can utilize the user filter functions on the streaming
results, offering excellent performance.

The best practice is therefore to use select operations via local, non-transactional operations,
and avoid using select on large tables in the transactional setting.

### No Nulls {#nonulls}

Pact has no concept of a NULL value in its database metaphor. The main function for computing
on database results, [with-read](pact-functions.html#with-read), will error if any column value is not found.
Authors must ensure that values are present for any transactional read. This is a safety feature
to ensure *totality* and avoid needless, unsafe control-flow surrounding null values.

### Versioned History {#dbversions}

The key-row model is augmented by every change to column values being versioned by transaction ID.
For example, a table with three columns "name", "age", and "role" might update "name" in transaction #1,
and "age" and "role" in transaction #2. Retrieving historical data will return just the change to "name"
under transaction 1, and the change to "age" and "role" in transaction #2.

### Back-ends {#backends}

Pact guarantees identical, correct execution at the smart-contract layer within the blockchain. As
a result, the backing store need not be identical on different consensus nodes.
Pact's implementation allows for integration of industrial RDBMSs, to assist large migrations onto
a blockchain-based system, by facilitating bulk replication of data to downstream systems.

Types and Schemas
---

With Pact 2.0, Pact gains explicit type specification, albeit optional. Pact 1.0 code without
types still functions as before, and writing code without types is attractive for rapid prototyping.

Schemas provide the main impetus for types. A schema [is defined](#defschema) with a list of
columns that can have types (although this is also not required). Tables are then [defined](#deftable)
with a particular schema (again, optional).

Note that schemas also can be used on/specified for object types.

### Runtime Type enforcement

Any types declared in code are enforced at runtime. For table schemas, this means any write
to a table will be typechecked against the schema. Otherwise, if a type specification is
encountered, the runtime enforces the type when the expression is evaluated.

### Static Type Inference on Modules

With the [typecheck](pact-functions.html#typecheck) repl command, the Pact interpreter will analyze a module
and attempt to infer types on every variable, function application or const definition.
Using this in project repl scripts is helpful to aid the developer in adding "just enough types"
to make the typecheck succeed. Successful typechecking is usually a matter of providing
schemas for all tables, and argument types for ancillary functions that call ambiguous or
overloaded native functions.

### Formal Verification

Pact's typechecker is designed to output a fully typechecked and inlined AST for generating
formal proofs in the SMT-LIB2 language. If the typecheck does not succeed, the module is not
considered "provable".

We see, then, that Pact code can move its way up a "safety" gradient, starting with no types,
then with "enough" types, and lastly, with formal proofs.

Note that as of Pact 2.0 the formal verification function is still under development.


Keysets and Authorization {#confidential-keysets}
---

Pact is inspired by Bitcoin scripts to incorporate public-key authorization directly into smart
contract execution and administration.

### Keyset definition

Keysets are [defined](pact-functions.html#define-keyset) by [reading](pact-functions.html#read-keyset) definitions from the message
payload. Keysets consist of a list of public keys and a *keyset predicate*.

Examples of valid keyset JSON productions:

```javascript
/* examples of valid keysets */
{
  "fully-specified-with-native-pred":
    { "keys": ["abc6bab9b88e08d","fe04ddd404feac2"], "pred": "keys-2" },

  "fully-specified-with-qual-custom":
    { "keys": ["abc6bab9b88e08d","fe04ddd404feac2"], "pred": "my-module.custom-pred" },

  "keysonly":
    { "keys": ["abc6bab9b88e08d","fe04ddd404feac2"] }, /* defaults to "keys-all" pred */

  "keylist": ["abc6bab9b88e08d","fe04ddd404feac2"] /* makes a "keys-all" pred keyset */
}

```


### Keyset Predicates {#keyset-predicates}

A keyset predicate references a function by its (optionally qualified) name, and will compare the public keys in the keyset
to the key or keys used to sign the blockchain message. The function accepts two arguments,
"count" and "matched", where "count" is the number of keys in the keyset and "matched" is how many
keys on the message signature matched a keyset key.

Support for multiple signatures is the responsibility of the blockchain layer, and is a powerful
feature for Bitcoin-style "multisig" contracts (i.e. requiring at least two signatures to release funds).

Pact comes with built-in keyset predicates: [keys-all](pact-functions.html#keys-all), [keys-any](pact-functions.html#keys-any), [keys-2](pact-functions.html#keys-2).
Module authors are free to define additional predicates.

If a keyset predicate is not specified, [keys-all](pact-functions.html#keys-all) is used by default.

### Key rotation {#keyrotation}

Keysets can be rotated, but only by messages authorized against the current keyset definition
and predicate. Once authorized, the keyset can be easily [redefined](#define-keyset).

### Module Table Guards {#tableguards}

When [creating](pact-functions.html#create-table) a table, a module name must also be specified. By this mechanism,
tables are "guarded" or "encapsulated" by the module, such that direct access to the table
via [data-access functions](pact-functions.html#database) is authorized only by the module's admin keyset. However,
*within module functions*, table access is unconstrained. This gives contract authors great
flexibility in designing data access, and is intended to enshrine the module as the main
"user" data access API.

### Row-level keysets {#rowlevelkeysets}

Keysets can be stored as a column value in a row, allowing for *row-level* authorization.
The following code indicates how this might be achieved:

```lisp
(defun create-account (id)
  (insert accounts id { "balance": 0.0, "keyset": (read-keyset "owner-keyset") }))

(defun read-balance (id)
  (with-read accounts id { "balance":= bal, "keyset":= ks }
    (enforce-keyset ks)
    (format "Your balance is {}" [bal])))
```

In the example, `create-account` reads a keyset definition from the message payload using [read-keyset](pact-functions.html#read-keyset)
to store as "keyset" in the table. `read-balance` only allows that owner's keyset to read the balance,
by first enforcing the keyset using [enforce-keyset](pact-functions.html#enforce-keyset).

Computational Model {#computation}
---

Here we cover various aspects of Pact's approach to computation.

### Turing-Incomplete {#turingincomplete}
Pact is turing-incomplete, in that there is no recursion (recursion is detected before execution
and results in an error) and no ability to loop indefinitely. Pact does support operation on
list structures via [map](pact-functions.html#map), [fold](pact-functions.html#fold) and [filter](pact-functions.html#filter), but since there is no ability
to define infinite lists, these are necessarily bounded.

Turing-incompleteness allows Pact module loading to resolve all references in advance, meaning that
instead of addressing functions in a lookup table, the function definition is directly injected (or "inlined")
into the callsite. This is an example of the performance advantages of a Turing-incomplete language.

### Single-assignment Variables {#variables}

Pact allows variable declarations in [let expressions](#let) and [bindings](#bindings). Variables are
immutable: they cannot be re-assigned, or modified in-place.

A common variable declaration
occurs in the [with-read](pact-functions.html#with-read) function, assigning variables to column values by name. The
[bind](pact-functions.html#bind) function offers this same functionality for objects.

Module-global constant values can be declared with [defconst](#defconst).

### Data Types {#datatypes}

Pact code can be explicitly typed, and is always strongly-typed under the hood as the native
functions perform strict type checking as indicated in their documented type signatures.

Pact's supported types are:

- [Strings](#strings)
- [Integers](#integers)
- [Decimals](#decimals)
- [Booleans](#booleans)
- [Key sets](#confidential-keysets)
- [Lists](#lists)
- [Objects](#objects)
- [Function](#defun) and [pact](#defpact) definitions
- [JSON values](#json)
- [Tables](#deftable)
- [Schemas](#defschema)


### Performance {#performance}

Pact is designed to maximize the performance of [transaction execution](#transaction-execution), penalizing
queries and module definition in favor of fast recording of business events on the blockchain.
Some tips for fast execution are:

#### Single-function transactions {#singlefunctiontx}
Design transactions so they can be executed with a single function call.

#### Call with references instead of `use` {#usereferences}
When calling module functions in transactions, use [reference syntax](#references) instead of importing
the module with [use](#use). When defining modules that reference other module functions, `use` is
fine, as those references will be inlined at module definition time.

#### Hardcoded arguments vs. message values {#argsvmsgs}
A transaction can encode values directly into the transactional code:

```
(accounts.transfer "Acct1" "Acct2" 100.00)
```
or it can read values from the message JSON payload:

```
(defun transfer-msg ()
  (transfer (read-msg "from") (read-msg "to")
            (read-decimal "amount")))
...
(accounts.transfer-msg)
```
The latter will execute slightly faster, as there is less code to interpret at transaction time.

#### Types as necessary
With table schemas, Pact will be strongly typed for most use cases, but functions that do not
use the database might still need types. Use the [typecheck](typecheck) REPL function to add
the necessary types. There is a small cost for type enforcement at runtime, and too many type
signatures can harm readability. However types can help document an API, so this is a judgement call.

### Control Flow {#controlflow}
Pact supports conditionals via [if](pact-functions.html#if), bounded looping, and of course function application.

#### "If" considered harmful {#evilif}
Consider avoiding `if` wherever possible: every branch makes code harder to understand and more
prone to bugs. The best practice is to put "what am I doing" code in the front-end, and "validate
this transaction which I intend to succeed" code in the smart contract.

Pact's original design left out `if` altogether (and looping), but it was decided that users should
be able to judiciously use these features as necessary.

#### Use enforce {#use-the-enforce-luke}
"If" should never be used to enforce business logic invariants: instead, [enforce](pact-functions.html#enforce) is
the right choice, which will fail the transaction.

Indeed, failure is the only *non-local exit* allowed by Pact. This reflects Pact's emphasis on
*totality*.

Note that [enforce-one](pact-functions.html#enforce-one) (added in Pact 2.3) allows for testing a list of enforcements such that
if any pass, the whole expression passes. This is the sole example in Pact of "exception catching"
in that a failed enforcement simply results in the next test being executed, short-circuiting
on success.

#### Use built-in keysets
The built-in keyset functions [keys-all](pact-functions.html#keys-all), [keys-any](pact-functions.html#keys-any), [keys-2](pact-functions.html#keys-2)
are hardcoded in the interpreter to execute quickly. Custom keysets require runtime resolution
which is slower.

### Functional Concepts {#fp}

Pact includes the functional-programming "greatest hits": [map](pact-functions.html#map), [fold](pact-functions.html#fold) and [filter](pact-functions.html#filter).
These all employ [partial application](#partial-application), where the list item is appended onto the application
arguments in order to serially execute the function.

```lisp
(map (+ 2) [1 2 3])
(fold (+) "" ["Concatenate" " " "me"])
```

Pact also has [compose](pact-functions.html#compose), which allows "chaining" applications in a functional style.

### Pure execution {#pure}
In certain contexts Pact can guarantee that computation is "pure", which simply means
that the database state will not be accessed or modified. Currently, `enforce`, `enforce-one`
and keyset predicate evaluation are all executed in a pure context. [defconst](#defconst)
memoization is also pure.

### LISP {#lisp}

Pact's use of LISP syntax is intended to make the code reflect its
runtime representation directly, allowing contract authors focus
directly on program execution. Pact code is stored in human-readable
form on the ledger, such that the code can be directly verified, but
the use of LISP-style [s-expression syntax](#sexp) allows this
code to execute quickly.

### Message Data {#messagedata}

Pact expects code to arrive in a message with a JSON payload and signatures. Message data
is read using [read-msg](pact-functions.html#read-msg) and related functions. While signatures are not directly
readable or writable, they are evaluated as part of [keyset predicate](#keysetpredicates)
enforcement.

#### JSON support {#json}

Values returned from Pact transactions are expected to be directly represented as JSON
values.

When reading values from a message via [read-msg](pact-functions.html#read-msg), Pact coerces JSON types
as follows:

- String -> String
- Number -> Integer (rounded)
- Boolean -> Boolean
- Object -> Object
- Array -> List
- Null -> JSON Value

Decimal values are represented as Strings and read using [read-decimal](pact-functions.html#read-decimal).


Confidentiality {#confidentiality}
---

Pact is designed to be used in a *confidentiality-preserving* environment, where messages
are only visible to a subset of participants. This has significant implications for
smart contract execution.

### Entities
An *entity* is a business participant that is able or not able to see a confidential message.
An entity might be a company, a group within a company, or an individual.

### Disjoint Databases {#disjointdbs}
Pact smart contracts operate on messages organized by a blockchain, and serve to produce a
database of record, containing results of transactional executions. In a confidential environment,
different entities execute different transactions, meaning the resulting databases are now
*disjoint*.

This does not affect Pact execution; however, database data can no longer enact a "two-sided
transaction", meaning we need a new concept to handle enacting a single transaction over
multiple disjoint datasets.

### Confidential Pacts {#confidential-pacts}

An important feature for confidentiality in Pact is the ability to orchestrate disjoint
transactions in sequence to be executed by targeted entities. This is described in the next section.

Asynchronous Transaction Automation with "Pacts" {#pacts}
---

"Pacts" are multi-stage sequential transactions that are defined as a single body of code called
a [pact](#defpact). Defining a multi-step interaction as a pact ensures that transaction participants will
enact an agreed sequence of operations, and offers a special "execution scope" that can be used
to create and manage data resources only during the lifetime of a given multi-stage interaction.

Pacts are a form of *coroutine*, which is a function that has multiple exit and re-entry points. Pacts
are composed of [steps](#step) such that only a single step is executed in a given blockchain transaction.
Steps can only be executed in strict sequential order.

A pact is defined with arguments, similarly to function definition. However, arguments values are only
evaluated in the execution of the initial step, after which those values are available unchanged to subsequent steps.
To share new values
with subsequent steps, a step can [yield](pact-functions.html#yield) values which the subsequent step can recover using
the special [resume](pact-functions.html#resume) binding form.

Pacts are designed to run in one of two different contexts, private and public. A private pact is
indicated by each step identifying a single entity to execute the step, while public steps do
not have entity indicators. A pact can only be uniformly public or private: if some steps
has entity indicators and others do not, this results in an error at load time.

### Public Pacts
Public pacts are comprised of steps that can only execute in strict sequence. Any enforcement of who can execute a step
happens within the code of the step expression. All steps are "manually" initiated by some participant
in the transaction with CONTINUATION commands sent into the blockchain.

### Private Pacts
Private pacts are comprised of steps that execute in sequence where each step only executes on entity
nodes as selected by the provided 'entity' argument in the step; other entity nodes "skip" the step.
Private pacts are executed automatically by the blockchain platform after the initial step is sent
in, with the executing entity's node automatically sending the CONTINUATION command for the next step.

### Failures, Rollbacks and Cancels

Failure handling is dramatically different in public and private pacts.

In public pacts, a rollback expression is specified to indicate that the pact can be "cancelled" at
this step with a participant sending in a CANCEL message before the next step is executed. Once the last
step of a pact has been executed, the pact will be finished and cannot be rolled back. Failures
in public steps are no different than a failure in a non-pact transaction: all changes are rolled back.
Pacts can therefore only be canceled explicitly and should be modeled to offer all necessary cancel options.

In private pacts, the sequential execution of steps is automated by the blockchain platform itself. A failure
results in a ROLLBACK message being sent from the executing entity node which will trigger any rollback expression
specified in the previous step, to be executed by that step's entity. This failure will then "cascade" to the
previous step as a new ROLLBACK transaction, completing when the first step is rolled back.

### Yield and Resume

A step can yield values to the following step using [yield](pact-functions.html#yield) and [resume](pact-functions.html#resume). In public,
this is an unforgeable value, as it is maintained within the blockchain pact scope. In private, this is
simply a value sent with a RESUME message from the executed entity.

### Pact execution scope and `pact-id`

Every time a pact is initiated, it is given a unique ID which is retrievable using the [pact-id](pact-functions.html#pact-id)
function, which will return the ID of the currently executing pact, or fail if not running within a pact
scope. This mechanism can thus be used to guard access to resources, analogous to the use of keysets and
signatures. One typical use of this is to create escrow accounts that can only be used within the context
of a given pact, eliminating the need for a trusted third party for many use-cases.

### Testing pacts

Pacts
can be tested in repl scripts using the [env-entity](pact-functions.html#env-entity), [env-step](pact-functions.html#env-step)
and [pact-state](pact-functions.html#pact-state) repl functions to simulate pact executions.

It is also possible to simulate pact execution in the pact server API by formatting [continuation Request](#request-yaml)
yaml files into API requests with a `cont` payload.

Dependency Management {#dependency-management}
---
Pact supports a number of features to manage a module's dependencies on other Pact modules.

### Module Hashes
Once loaded, a Pact module is associated with a hash computed from the module's source code text.
This module hash uniquely identifies the version of the module.
Module hashes can be examined with [describe-module](pact-functions.html#describe-module):

```
pact> (at "hash" (describe-module 'accounts))
"9d6f4d3acb2fd528206330d09a8926da6abdd9ac5e8c4b24cc35955203f234688c25f9545ead56f783c5269fe4be6a62aa89162caf811142572ac172dc2adb91"
```

### Pinning module versions with `use`
The [use](#use) special form allows
a module hash to be specified, in order to pin the dependency version. When
used within a module declaration, it introduces the dependency
hash value into the module's hash.
This allows a "dependency-only" upgrade to push the upgrade to the module version.

### Inlined Dependencies: "No Leftpad"
When a module is loaded, all references to foreign modules are resolved, and their code is
directly inlined. At this point, upstream definitions are permanent: the only way to upgrade
dependencies is to reload the original module.

This permanence is great for user code: once a module is loaded, an upstream provider cannot change what code
is executed within. However, this creates a big problem
for upstream developers, as they cannot upgrade the downstream code themselves in order to address an exploit, or to
introduce new features.

### Blessing hashes
A trade-off is needed to balance these opposing interests. Pact offers the ability for upstream
code to break downstream dependent code at runtime. Table access is guarded to enforce
that the module hash of the inlined dependency either matches the runtime version, or
is in a set of "blessed" hashes, as specified by [bless](#bless) in the module declaration:

```lisp
(module provider 'keyset
  (bless "e4cfa39a3d37be31c59609e807970799caa68a19bfaa15135f165085e01d41a65ba1e1b146aeb6bd0092b49eac214c103ccfa3a365954bbbe52f74a2b3620c94")
  (bless "ca002330e69d3e6b84a46a56a6533fd79d51d97a3bb7cad6c2ff43b354185d6dc1e723fb3db4ae0737e120378424c714bb982d9dc5bbd7a0ab318240ddd18f8d")
  ...
)
```

Dependencies with these hashes will continue to function after the module is loaded.
Unrecognized hashes will cause the transaction to fail. However, "pure" code that does
not access the database is unaffected. This prevents a "leftpad situation" where trivial
utility functions can harm downstream code stability.

### Phased upgrades with "v2" modules
Upstream providers can use the bless mechanism to phase in an important upgrade, by renaming
the upgraded module to indicate the new version, and replacing the old module with a new,
empty module that only blesses the last version (and whatever earlier versions desired).
New clients will
fail to import the "v1" code, requiring them to use the new version,
while existing users can continue to use the old version,
presumably up to some advertised time limit. The "empty" module can offer migration
functions to handle migrating user data to the new module, for the user to self-upgrade
in the time window.


Syntax
======

Literals {#literals}
--------

### Strings {#strings}

String literals are created with double-ticks:

```
pact> "a string"
"a string"
```

Strings also support multiline by putting a backslash before and after whitespace (not interactively).

```lisp
(defun id (a)
  "Identity function. \
  \Argument is returned."
  a)
```

### Symbols {#symbols}

Symbols are string literals representing some unique item in the runtime, like a function or a table name.
Their representation internally is simply a string literal so their usage is idiomatic.

Symbols are created with a preceding tick, thus they do not support whitespace nor multiline syntax.

```
pact> 'a-symbol
"a-symbol"
```

### Integers {#integers}

Integer literals are unbounded, and can be positive or negative.

```
pact> 12345
12345
pact> -922337203685477580712387461234
-922337203685477580712387461234
```

### Decimals {#decimals}

Decimal literals have potentially unlimited precision.

```
pact> 100.25
100.25
pact> -356452.234518728287461023856582382983746
-356452.234518728287461023856582382983746
```

### Booleans {#booleans}

Booleans are represented by `true` and `false` literals.

```
pact> (and true false)
false
```

### Lists {#lists}

List literals are created with brackets, and optionally separated with commas.
Uniform literal lists are given a type in parsing.
```
pact> [1 2 3]
[1 2 3]
pact> [1,2,3]
[1 2 3]
pact> (typeof [1 2 3])
"[integer]"
pact> (typeof [1 2 true])
"list"
```

### Objects {#objects}

Objects are dictionaries, created with curly-braces specifying key-value pairs
using a colon `:`.
For certain applications (database updates), keys must be strings.

```
pact> { "foo": (+ 1 2), "bar": "baz" }
(TObject [("foo",3),("bar","baz")])
```

### Bindings {#bindings}
Bindings are dictionary-like forms, also created with curly braces, to bind
database results to variables using the `:=` operator.
They are used in [with-read](pact-functions.html#with-read), [with-default-read](pact-functions.html#with-default-read),
[bind](pact-functions.html#bind) and [resume](pact-functions.html#resume) to assign variables to named columns in a row, or values in an object.

```lisp
(defun check-balance (id)
  (with-read accounts id { "balance" := bal }
    (enforce (> bal 0) (format "Account in overdraft: {}" [bal]))))
```

Type specifiers
-----

Types can be specified in syntax with the colon `:` operator followed by
a type literal or user type specification.

### Type literals

- `string`
- `integer`
- `decimal`
- `bool`
- `time`
- `keyset`
- `list`, or `[type]` to specify the list type
- `object`, which can be further typed with a schema
- `table`, which can be further typed with a schema
- `value` (JSON values)

### Schema type literals

A schema defined with [defschema](#defschema) is referenced by name enclosed in curly braces.

```lisp
table:{accounts}
object:{person}
```

### What can be typed

#### Function arguments and return types
```lisp
(defun prefix:string (pfx:string str:string) (+ pfx str))
```

#### Let variables
```lisp
(let ((a:integer 1) (b:integer 2)) (+ a b))
```

#### Tables and objects
Tables and objects can only take a schema type literal.
```lisp
(deftable accounts:{account})

(defun get-order:{order} (id) (read orders id))
```

#### Consts
```lisp
(defconst PENNY:decimal 0.1)
```


Special forms {#special-forms}
---

### Docs and Metadata
Many special forms like [defun](#defun) accept optional documentation strings,
in the following form:

```lisp
(defun average (a b)
  "take the average of a and b"
  (/ (+ a b) 2))
```

Alternately, users can specify metadata using a special `@`-prefix syntax.
Supported metadata fields are `@doc` to provide a documentation string, and `@model`
that can be used by Pact tooling to verify the correctness of the implementation:

```lisp
(defun average (a b)
  @doc   "take the average of a and b"
  @model (property (= (+ a b) (* 2 result)))
  (/ (+ a b) 2))
```

Indeed, a bare docstring like `"foo"` is actually just a short form for `@doc "foo"`.

Specific information on *Properties* can be found in [The Pact Property Checking System](pact-properties.html).

### bless {#bless}
```
(bless HASH)
```

Within a module declaration, bless a previous version of that module as identified by HASH.
See [Dependency management](#dependency-management) for a discussion of the blessing mechanism.

```lisp
(module provider 'keyset
  (bless "e4cfa39a3d37be31c59609e807970799caa68a19bfaa15135f165085e01d41a65ba1e1b146aeb6bd0092b49eac214c103ccfa3a365954bbbe52f74a2b3620c94")
  (bless "ca002330e69d3e6b84a46a56a6533fd79d51d97a3bb7cad6c2ff43b354185d6dc1e723fb3db4ae0737e120378424c714bb982d9dc5bbd7a0ab318240ddd18f8d")
  ...
)
```


### defun {#defun}

```lisp
(defun NAME ARGLIST [DOC-OR-META] BODY...)
```

Define NAME as a function, accepting ARGLIST arguments, with optional DOC-OR-META.
Arguments are in scope for BODY, one or more expressions.

```lisp
(defun add3 (a b c) (+ a (+ b c)))

(defun scale3 (a b c s)
  "multiply sum of A B C times s"
  (* s (add3 a b c)))
```

### defconst {#defconst}
```lisp
(defconst NAME VALUE [DOC-OR-META])
```

Define NAME as VALUE, with option DOC-OR-META. Value is evaluated upon module load and "memoized".

```lisp
(defconst COLOR_RED="#FF0000" "Red in hex")
(defconst COLOR_GRN="#00FF00" "Green in hex")
(defconst PI 3.14159265 "Pi to 8 decimals")
```

### defpact {#defpact}

```
(defpact NAME ARGLIST [DOC-OR-META] STEPS...)
```


Define NAME as a _pact_, a computation comprised of multiple steps that occur
in distinct transactions.
Identical to [defun](#defun) except body must be comprised of [steps](#step) to be
executed in strict sequential order. Steps must uniformly be "public" (no entity indicator)
or "private" (with entity indicator). With private steps, failures result in a reverse-sequence
"rollback cascade".

```lisp
(defpact payment (payer payer-entity payee
                  payee-entity amount)
  (step-with-rollback payer-entity
    (debit payer amount)
    (credit payer amount))
  (step payee-entity
    (credit payee amount)))
```

### defschema {#defschema}

```
(defschema NAME [DOC-OR-META] FIELDS...)
```

Define NAME as a _schema_, which specifies a list of FIELDS. Each field
is in the form `FIELDNAME[:FIELDTYPE]`.

```lisp
(defschema accounts
  "Schema for accounts table".
  balance:decimal
  amount:decimal
  ccy:string
  data)
```

### deftable {#deftable}

```
(deftable NAME[:SCHEMA] [DOC-OR-META])
```

Define NAME as a _table_, used in database functions. Note the
table must still be created with [create-table](pact-functions.html#create-table).

### let {#let}

```
(let (BINDPAIR [BINDPAIR [...]]) BODY)
```

Bind variables in BINDPAIRs to be in scope over BODY. Variables
within BINDPAIRs cannot refer to previously-declared variables in
the same let binding; for this use [let\*](#letstar).

```lisp
(let ((x 2)
      (y 5))
  (* x y))
> 10
```

### let&#42; {#letstar}

```
(let* (BINDPAIR [BINDPAIR [...]]) BODY)
```

Bind variables in BINDPAIRs to be in scope over BODY. Variables
can reference previously declared BINDPAIRS in the same let.
`let*` is expanded at compile-time to nested `let` calls for
each BINDPAIR; thus `let` is preferred where possible.

```lisp
(let* ((x 2)
       (y (* x 10)))
  (+ x y))
> 22
```

### step {#step}
```
(step EXPR)
(step ENTITY EXPR)
```

Define a step within a [defpact](#defpact), such that any prior steps will be
executed in prior transactions, and later steps in later transactions.
Including an ENTITY argument indicates that this step is intended for confidential
transactions. Therefore, only the ENTITY would execute the step, and other
participants would "skip" it.

### step-with-rollback {#step-with-rollback}
```
(step-with-rollback EXPR ROLLBACK-EXPR)
(step-with-rollback ENTITY EXPR ROLLBACK-EXPR)
```

Define a step within a [defpact](#defpact) similarly to [step](#step) but specifying ROLLBACK-EXPR.
With ENTITY, ROLLBACK-EXPR will only be executed upon failure of a subsequent step, as part of a reverse-sequence "rollback
cascade" going back from the step that failed to the first step. Without ENTITY,
ROLLBACK-EXPR functions as a "cancel function" to be explicitly executed by a participant.

### use {#use}
```
(use MODULE)
(use MODULE HASH)
```

Import an existing MODULE into a namespace. Can only be issued at the top-level, or within a module
declaration. MODULE can be a string, symbol or bare atom. With HASH, validate that the imported module's
hash matches HASH, failing if not. Use [describe-module](pact-functions.html#describe-module) to query for the
hash of a loaded module on the chain.

```lisp
(use accounts)
(transfer "123" "456" 5 (time "2016-07-22T11:26:35Z"))
"Write succeeded"
```

### module {#module}
```
(module NAME KEYSET [DOC-OR-META] DEFS...)
```

Define and install module NAME, guarded by keyset KEYSET, with optional DOC-OR-META.
DEFS must be [defun](#defun) or [defpact](#defpact) expressions only.

```lisp
(module accounts 'accounts-admin
  "Module for interacting with accounts"

  (defun create-account (id bal)
   "Create account ID with initial balance BAL"
   (insert accounts id { "balance": bal }))

  (defun transfer (from to amount)
   "Transfer AMOUNT from FROM to TO"
   (with-read accounts from { "balance": fbal }
    (enforce (<= amount fbal) "Insufficient funds")
     (with-read accounts to { "balance": tbal }
      (update accounts from { "balance": (- fbal amount) })
      (update accounts to { "balance": (+ tbal amount) }))))
)
```

Expressions {#expression}
---

Expressions may be [literals](#literals), atoms, s-expressions, or references.


### Atoms {#atom}

Atoms are non-reserved barewords starting with a letter or allowed symbol, and containing letters,
digits and allowed symbols. Allowed symbols are `%#+-_&$@<>=?*!|/`. Atoms must
resolve to a variable bound by a [defun](#defun), [defpact](#defpact), [binding](#bindings) form,
or to symbols imported into the namespace with [use](#use).

### S-expressions {#sexp}

S-expressions are formed with parentheses, with the first atom determining if
the expression is a [special form](#special-forms) or a function application, in
which case the first atom must refer to a definition.

#### Partial application {#partialapplication}
An application with less than the required arguments is in some contexts a valid
*partial application* of the function. However, this is only supported in
Pact's [functional-style functions](#functional-concepts); anywhere else this will result in a
runtime error.

### References {#references}

References are multiple atoms joined by a dot `.` that directly resolve to definitions found
in other modules.

```
pact> accounts.transfer
"(defun accounts.transfer (src,dest,amount,date) \"transfer AMOUNT from
SRC to DEST\")"
pact> transfer
Eval failure:
transfer<EOF>: Cannot resolve transfer
pact> (use 'accounts)
"Using \"accounts\""
pact> transfer
"(defun accounts.transfer (src,dest,amount,date) \"transfer AMOUNT from
SRC to DEST\")"
```

References are preferred over `use` for transactions, as references resolve faster.
However, when defining a module, `use` is preferred for legibility.

Time formats
===

Pact leverages the Haskell [thyme library](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/thyme) for fast
computation of time values. The [parse-time](pact-functions.html#parse-time) and [format-time](pact-functions.html#format-time)
functions accept format codes that derive from GNU `strftime` with some extensions, as follows:

`%%` - literal `"%"`

`%z` - RFC 822/ISO 8601:1988 style numeric time zone (e.g., `"-0600"` or `"+0100"`)

`%N` - ISO 8601 style numeric time zone (e.g., `"-06:00"` or `"+01:00"`) /EXTENSION/

`%Z` - timezone name

`%c` - The preferred calendar time representation for the current locale. As 'dateTimeFmt' `locale` (e.g. `%a %b %e %H:%M:%S %Z %Y`)

`%R` - same as `%H:%M`

`%T` - same as `%H:%M:%S`

`%X` - The preferred time of day representation for the current locale. As 'timeFmt' `locale` (e.g. `%H:%M:%S`)

`%r` - The complete calendar time using the AM/PM format of the current locale. As 'time12Fmt' `locale` (e.g. `%I:%M:%S %p`)

`%P` - day-half of day from ('amPm' `locale`), converted to lowercase, `"am"`, `"pm"`

`%p` - day-half of day from ('amPm' `locale`), `"AM"`, `"PM"`

`%H` - hour of day (24-hour), 0-padded to two chars, `"00"`–`"23"`

`%k` - hour of day (24-hour), space-padded to two chars, `" 0"`–`"23"`

`%I` - hour of day-half (12-hour), 0-padded to two chars, `"01"`–`"12"`

`%l` - hour of day-half (12-hour), space-padded to two chars, `" 1"`–`"12"`

`%M` - minute of hour, 0-padded to two chars, `"00"`–`"59"`

`%S` - second of minute (without decimal part), 0-padded to two chars, `"00"`–`"60"`

`%v` - microsecond of second, 0-padded to six chars, `"000000"`–`"999999"`. /EXTENSION/

`%Q` - decimal point and fraction of second, up to 6 second decimals, without trailing zeros.
       For a whole number of seconds, `%Q` produces the empty string. /EXTENSION/

`%s` - number of whole seconds since the Unix epoch. For times before
the Unix epoch, this is a negative number. Note that in `%s.%q` and `%s%Q`
the decimals are positive, not negative. For example, 0.9 seconds
before the Unix epoch is formatted as `"-1.1"` with `%s%Q`.

`%D` - same as `%m\/%d\/%y`

`%F` - same as `%Y-%m-%d`

`%x` - as 'dateFmt' `locale` (e.g. `%m\/%d\/%y`)

`%Y` - year, no padding.

`%y` - year of century, 0-padded to two chars, `"00"`–`"99"`

`%C` - century, no padding.

`%B` - month name, long form ('fst' from 'months' `locale`), `"January"`–`"December"`

`%b`, `%h` - month name, short form ('snd' from 'months' `locale`), `"Jan"`–`"Dec"`

`%m` - month of year, 0-padded to two chars, `"01"`–`"12"`

`%d` - day of month, 0-padded to two chars, `"01"`–`"31"`

`%e` - day of month, space-padded to two chars, `" 1"`–`"31"`

`%j` - day of year, 0-padded to three chars, `"001"`–`"366"`

## Default format and JSON serialization

The default format is a UTC ISO8601 date+time format: "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ", as accepted by the [time](pact-functions.html#id4)
function. While the time object internally supports up to microsecond resolution, values returned from the Pact
interpreter as JSON will be serialized with the default format. When higher resolution is desired, explicitly format
times with `%v` and related codes.

## Examples

### ISO8601

```
pact> (format-time "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%N" (time "2016-07-23T13:30:45Z"))
"2016-07-23T13:30:45+00:00"
```

### RFC822

```
pact> (format-time "%a, %_d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %Z" (time "2016-07-23T13:30:45Z"))
"Sat, 23 Jul 2016 13:30:45 UTC"
```

### YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.000000

```
pact> (format-time "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%v" (add-time (time "2016-07-23T13:30:45Z") 0.001002))
"2016-07-23 13:30:45.001002"
```


# Database Serialization Format

## IMPORTANT EXPERIMENTAL/BETA WARNING

This section documents the database serialization format starting with Pact 2.4.* versions. However, this
format is still in BETA as we are only recently starting to work with concrete RDBMS back-ends and deployments
that directly export this data.

As a result we make NO COMMITMENT TO BACKWARD-COMPATIBILITY of these formats and reserve the right to move
to improved formats in future versions. API stability in Pact prioritizes client-facing compatibility and
performance first, with backend export still being an experimental feature.

We do expect these formats to stabilize in the future at which time backward compatibility will be guaranteed.


## Key-Value Format with JSON values

Pact stores all values to the backing database in a two-column key-value structure with all values expressed as JSON.
This approach is motivated by transparency and portability:

_Transparency_: JSON is a human-readable format which allows visual verification of values.

_Portability_: JSON enjoys strong support in nearly every database backend at time of writing (2018). The key-value
structure allows using even non-RDBMS backends like RocksDB etc, and also keeps SQL DDL very straightforward,
with simple primary key structure. Indexing is not supported nor required.

## Pact Datatype Codec

For all supported Pact datatypes, they are encoded into JSON using a special codec that is different than the
JSON format used in the front-end API, designed for serialization speed and correctness.

### Integer

For non-large integers, values are directly encoded as JSON numbers.

What is considered a "large integer"
in JSON/Javascript is subject to debate; we use the range `[-2^53 .. 2^53]` as specified
[here](http://blog.vjeux.com/2010/javascript/javascript-max_int-number-limits.html). For
large integers, we encode a JSON singleton object with the stringified integer value:

```javascript
/* small integers are just a number */
1
/* large integers are objects */
{ "_P_int": "123..." /* integer string representation */
}
```

### Decimal

Decimals are encoded using _places_ and _mantissa_ following the
[Haskell Decimal format](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Decimal-0.5.1/docs/Data-Decimal.html#t:DecimalRaw):

```javascript
{ "_P_decp": 4     /* decimal places */
, "_P_decm": 15246 /* decimal mantissa, encoded using INTEGER format */
}
```

Note that the mantissa value uses the integer format described above.
As described in the Decimal docs, the value can be computed as follows:

```
MANTISSA / (10 ^ PLACES)
```

### Boolean

Booleans are stored as JSON booleans.

### String

Strings are stored as JSON strings.

### Time

Times are stored in a JSON object capturing a Modified Julian Day value and a day-local microsecond value.

```javascript
{ "_P_timed": 234 /* "modified julian day value */
, "_P_timems": 32495874 /* microseconds, encoded using INTEGER format */
}
```

Suggestions for converting MJDs can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11889553/convert-modified-julian-date-to-utc).

### JSON Value/Blob

Raw JSON blobs are encoded unmodified in a container object.

```javascript
{ "_P_val": { "foo": "bar" } /* unmodified user JSON object */
}
```

### Keyset

Keysets store the key list and predicate name in a JSON object.

```javascript
{ "_P_keys": ["key1","key2"] /* public key string representations */
, "_P_pred": "keys-all"      /* predicate function name */
}
```

## Module (User) Tables

For each module table specified in Pact code, two backend tables are created: the "data table" and the "transaction table".

### Column names

Names for all key value tables are simply **t_key** and **t_value**.

### User Data table

The data table supports CRUD-style access to the current table state.

- **Naming**: `USER_[module]_[table]`.
- **Key Format**: Keys are text/VARCHARs, and maximum length supported is backend-dependent.
- **Value format**: JSON object, with user-specified keys and codec-transformed values.

### User Transaction Table

The transaction table logs all updates to the table.

- **Naming**: `TX_[module]_[table]`
- **Key Format**: Keys are integers, using backend-specific BIGINT values, reflecting the transaction ID being recorded.
- **Value format**: JSON array of updates in a particular transaction.

The update format is a JSON object:

```javascript
{ "table": "name"  /* user-visible table name (not backend table name) */
, "key": "123"     /* update string key */
, "value": { ... } /* The new JSON row value. Entire row is captured. */
```

Note that the JSON row value uses the same encoding as found in the user data table.
