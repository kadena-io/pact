-- | Lift a function to an array. Useful for creating arrays in a pure context. (Otherwise use `newArray`.)
-- A simple way to create an array such that reading an unintialized value is assigned a free variable is
-- to simply use an uninterpreted function. That is, use:
--
--  @ mkSFunArray (uninterpret "initial") @
--
-- Note that this will ensure all uninitialized reads to the same location will return the same value,
-- without constraining them otherwise; with different indexes containing different values.

-- SFunArrays are only "Mergeable". Although a brute
-- force equality can be defined, any non-toy instance
-- will suffer from efficiency issues; so we don't define it
